            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Divide the Councils aright, and let each have his own due part and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then all the five firſt, and ſo much as they account the ſixt, that is, all which were held for 600. yeares and more; All the golden Councils, and of the golden ages of the Church, are ours onely, and not theirs, in many and even in the maine points of Religion, repugnant to them and their doctrines: but in every Decree, Canon, and Conſtitution of faith, ſo conſonant to us, that we not onely embrace, but earneſtly defend them all, as the rightfull and proper inheritance left unto us by thoſe holy Fathers of the ancient and Catholike Church. The middle ranke, beginning at the ſecond <hi>Nicene,</hi> unto the Councill of <hi>Florence,</hi> which were held in thoſe ages of the mingled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Church, none of them are either wholly ours or wholly theirs, thoſe miſcellane Councils, are neither thine nor mine, but they muſt all be divided. The two laſt, the one at <hi>Laterane,</hi> the other at <hi>Trent,</hi> which are the very lees and dreggs of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, held onely by ſuch as were the droſſe of the Church quite ſevered from the gold, wee willingly yeeld unto them: they and they onely are wholly theirs, let them have, let them enjoy their <hi>Helenaes,</hi> we envy not ſuch refuſe Councils unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When firſt I ſet my ſelfe to the handling of this argument
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7680:13"/> concerning the Councils, it was my purpoſe, beſides thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generall queſtions, concerning the right of calling generall Councils, the right of Preſidencie in them, and the right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them, to have made manifeſt thoſe three ſeverall points, touching thoſe three rankes of Councils; every one of which, is not onely true, but even demonſtrable in it ſelfe. And though with a delightfull kind of toile I have made no ſmall progreſſe therein, yet alas, how unequall am I to ſuch an <hi>Herculean</hi> labour? whoſe time, whoſe ſtrength of body, or induſtry of minde, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to accompliſh a worke of ſuch amplitude, and of ſo vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for which not <hi>Neſtors</hi> age would ſuffice? Wherefore tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſailes, from this ſo long, and tedious a voyage, which I could not ſo much as hope to end, &amp; which beſide many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rockes, hidden Syrtes and ſands, is every where beſet by many Romane enemies, ſpecially by <hi>Baronius</hi> the Archpirate of this and former ages, with whom at every turne, almoſt, one ſhall be ſure to have an hot encounter; I thought a ſhorter courſe far more fit, for my ſmall and unfurniſht barke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of more or longer voyages, I ſhall be glad if God will enable me to make but a cut onely over ſome one arme of that great Ocean, not doubting but the ice being once broken, and the paſſage through theſe ſtraits opened, many other will with more facilitie, and felicitie alſo, performe the like in the reſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the whole journey through every part of theſe ſeas be at length fully accompliſhed.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4.

After all theſe juſt Anathemaes denounced as well in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as in particular by the Councill againſt the defenders of theſe <hi>Three Chapters</hi> or any one of them; the holy Synod ſets downe in the laſt place one other point as memorable as any of the former: And that is by what authority they decreed all theſe things, of which they thus ſay,<note n="s" place="margin">Col. <hi>8.</hi> pa. <hi>588.</hi> a.</note> we have rightly confeſſed theſe things, <hi>quae tradita ſunt nobis tam à divinis ſcripturis; which are delivered unto us both in the divine ſcriptures, and in the doctrines of the holy Fathers, and in the definitions of faith made by the foure former Councils.</hi> So the holy Councill. Whence it doth evidently enſue, that to teach and affirme, that the Pope in his judiciall and cathedrall ſentence of faith may erre and define hereſie, and that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in his conſtitution <hi>de facto</hi> did ſo, is a truth conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Scriptures, fathers, and the foure firſt general Councils: But on the other ſide, to maintaine or affirme (as do all who are members of the preſent Romane Church) that the Popes cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall ſentence in cauſes of faith is <hi>infallible,</hi> is an hereticall poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repugnant to Scriptures, Fathers, and the 4. firſt Councils, and condemned by them all. So at once the Holy Councill judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially defineth both our faith to be truly ancient &amp; Apoſtolical, the ſelfe ſame which the Holy Fathers, generall Councills, and the Catholike Church profeſſed for 600 yeares; and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the preſent Romane Church, even that fundamentall poſition, on which all the reſt doe relye, to be not onely new,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7680:25"/> but hereticall, ſuch as none can maintaine, but even thereby he oppugneth and contradicteth both the Scriptures, Fathers, the foure firſt general Councils; and the Catholike Church for 600 yeares after Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Further yet: becauſe one part of their ſentence is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſing of all who defend the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> either expreſly, as did <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or <hi>implicitè,</hi> and by conſequent, as do all who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Popes judgement in cauſes of faith to be infallible, that is, al who are members of the preſent Romane Church, and ſo die; it cleerely enſueth from that laſt clauſe of the Councill, that to condemne and accuſſe as heretikes all theſe, yea, all which doe not accurſe theſe, is by the judgement of this whole generall Council, warranted by Scriptures, by Fathers, by the foure firſt generall Councils, and by the Caholike Church for 600 yeares after Chriſt: The judgement of this fifth Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſonant to them all, and warranted by them all.</p>
               <p n="26">26.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7680:26"/> heart beleeve, and in words profeſſe and teach, that the Popes Cathedrall ſentence in cauſes of faith, may be, and <hi>de facto</hi> hath been hereticall: that is, they all did beleeve and teach, that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which the reformed Churches maintaine, to be truly anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, orthodoxall and catholike, ſuch as the whole Church of Chriſt for more then 14 hundred yeares beleeved and taught: but the doctrine (even the Fundamentall poſition whereon all their doctrines doe relie, and which is vertually included in them all) which the preſent Church of Rome maintaineth, to be new, hereticall and accurſed, ſuch as the whole Church for ſo many hundred yeares together with one conſent beleeved and taught to be accurſed and hereticall. It hence further enſueth, that as this fift Councill did, ſo all the fore-mentioned generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Popes and Biſhops, doe with it condemne and accurſe for heretikes not onely <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but all who either have or doe hereafter defend him and his <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> even all, who either by word or writing, have or ſhall maintaine that the Popes <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall</hi> judgement in cauſes of faith is infallible, that is, all who are members of the preſent Romane Church, and ſo continue till their death: nay, they not onely accurſe all ſuch, but further alſo, even all who doe not accurſe ſuch. And becauſe the decree of this fift Councill is approved by them, to the leaſt <hi>iôta,</hi> it in the laſt place followeth, that the condemning and accurſing for hereticall that doctrine of the Popes infallibilitie in cauſes of faith, and accurſing for heretikes, all who either by word or writing have, or doe at any time hereafter defend the ſame, and ſo preſiſt till they dye; nay, not onely the accurſing of all ſuch, but of all who doe not accurſe them, is warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by Fathers, by all generall Councils, by all Popes and Biſhops, that have beene for more then 14. hundred yeares after Chriſt.</p>

And if their Popes continue (as it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed they doe) to make that profeſsion which by the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> they are bound to doe, to hold among other, this fift Councill <hi>ad unum iôta,</hi> this certainly is but a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, no cordiall profeſsion; there neither is, nor can be any truth therein, it being impoſſible to beleeve both the Popes <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall</hi> judgement in cauſes of faith, to be <hi>hereticall,</hi> as the fift <hi>Councill</hi> defined; and the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> ſentence in ſuch cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to be <hi>infallible,</hi> as their <hi>Laterane Councill</hi> decreed: So by that profeſſion is demonſtrated that their doctrine of faith is both contradictory to it ſelfe, ſuch as none can poſſibly beleeve, and withall new, ſuch as is repugnant to that faith which the <hi>whole Catholike Church of Chriſt</hi> embraced, untill that very day of their <hi>Laterane</hi> Seſſion.</p>

As <hi>Vigilius</hi> and other followers of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> did not at this time broach any new hereſie, but under thoſe <hi>Three Chapters</hi> on which they put the viſor of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> ſought to revive the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> which before, when it came in its owne habit, was condemned: Even ſo the fift Councell needed not, neither did they condemne any new, but unmasked the old &amp; condemned hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> lurking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the defence of theſe <hi>Three Chapters;</hi> they pulled off the viſor of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> from it, under which it moſt ſubtilly now ſought to inſinuate it ſelfe, and creep into the Church. And when <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, that in this fift Councell they dealt <hi>tantummodo de perſonis,</hi> that <hi>tantummodo,</hi> in his ſenſe doth not exclude all handling of the faith, not the explaning, not the corroborating of the faith, for both theſe they certainly did, and <hi>Gregory</hi> acknowledgeth: but it onely excludes ſuch an handling of the faith as was uſed ar <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi>

The fift Councell dealt onely with perſons, without making ſuch a Decree; yet it dealt with thoſe perſons with an intent to explane and corroborate thoſe <hi>Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> decrees.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The words of <hi>Gregory</hi> next following thoſe on which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> relied, doe yet more fully explane this to have beene his meaning.

                  <hi>perſons nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or ſet downe in the Councell at Chalcedon.</hi> For as there is much contained in that Councell concerning thoſe perſons, eſpecially <hi>Ibas,</hi> (in whoſe cauſe, and the examining therof, two<note n="a" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="20">20. By all which the true meaning of <hi>Gregory</hi> is now by his owne explaning moſt evident. In the fift Councell nothing was done contrary to the faith, (as the malignant ſlanderers of this Councell pretended) nothing was done <hi>de novo, to condemne any new hereſie;</hi> nothing was done abſolutely, or without reference to theſe <hi>Three Chapters:</hi> all this <hi>Gregory</hi> truly intendeth, when he ſaith, nothing was done therein concerning the faith: but ſeeing all that was done in the Councell, was done to explane, confirme &amp; corroborate the faith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Epheſus;</hi> as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> himſelfe profeſſeth, it undoubtedly followeth, that even for this cauſe, and by <hi>Gregories</hi> owne teſtimonie, the queſtion here defined was a cauſe and queſtion of faith. Vpon <hi>Gregories</hi> words the Cardinall might well have collected, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> erred not in any new hereſie, or new queſtion of faith, ſuch as was not before condemned; but that he erred not at all in a cauſe of faith, is ſo farre from the intent of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that out of his expreſſe words the quite contrary is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be collected. For how can the Pope be ſaid not at all to erre in the faith, when by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Conſtitution he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth that cauſe of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> the defending whereof contradicteth a former definition of faith, and utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the holy Councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> yea, the whole Catholike faith?</p>

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> fancie; becauſe the <hi>Sardican</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> were held to be one and the ſame Councell, (for neither were they ſo indeed, being called by different Emperours, to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent places, at different times, and upon different occaſions; neither were they ever by the ancient, or any of ſound judgement held for one Synod) but the true reaſon thereof was this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Sardicane,</hi> though in dignity &amp; authority it was equall to the <hi>Nicene,</hi> yet onely confirmed the Decree of faith formerly made at <hi>Nice;</hi> and made no new or <hi>Introductive</hi> decree, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any hereſie, as did the other at <hi>Nice.</hi> And truly for the ſelfe ſame reaſon, the Church might, if they had pleaſed, have done the like to this fift Councell, and not have accounted it no more than they did the <hi>Sardicane,</hi> in a diſtinct number; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed it a Councell <hi>corroborative</hi> of the Councell at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> as that at <hi>Sardica</hi> was of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, which ſome Churches alſo did, as by the 14.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7680:35"/> it is evidently proved ſo nearely to concerne the faith, that to defend theſe Chapters (which <hi>Vigilius</hi> did) is to enervate and overthrow; and to condemne them (which the Councell did) is to uphold and confirme the Holy Catholike faith. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this alone (if I ſhould ſay no more) were ſufficient to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to this firſt Evaſion of <hi>Baronius;</hi> yet, that both the truth hereof may more fully and further appeare; and that the moſt vile and ſhameleſſe dealing of <hi>Baronius</hi> in this cauſe, ſuch, as I thinke few heretikes have ever parallel'd, may be palpable unto all; To that which hitherto we have ſpoken in generall concerning all theſe <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> I purpoſe now to adde a particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of each of them by it ſelfe; whereby it will be evident, that every one of theſe Chapters doth ſo directly concerne the faith; that the defence of any one of them, but eſpecially of the two laſt, is an oppugnation, yea, an abnegation of the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith.</p>

               <p n="5">5.

The Cardinall was too diminutive in his extenuations, when he ſpake ſo faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The holy Church doth not ſo generally receive it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Let us beare with the Cardinals tenderneſſe of heart: the Popes ſores muſt not be touched, but with ſoft, and tender hands. Seeing the Cardinall hath brought the Pope, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church to be at ods, and at an unreconciliable contradiction; the Pope denying, the Church affirming, that <hi>a man after his death may</hi> noviter <hi>be condemned,</hi> it is well worth the labour to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7680:38"/> examine, whether part the Cardinall himſelfe will take in this quarrell; you may be ſure, the choyce on either part was very hard for him: he hath here a worſe matter than a wolfe by the eares. This is <hi>dignus vindice nodus,</hi> a point which will trie the Cardinals art, wiſdome, piety, conſtancy, and faire dealing: And in very deed, he hath herein plaid <hi>Sir Politike would be,</hi> above the degree of commendation. The Cardinall is a man of peace, hee loves not to diſpleaſe either the Pope, or the Church; he knew, that to provoke either of them, would bring an armie of waſpes about his eares; and therfore very gravely, wiſely, and diſcreetly he takes part with them both: and though their aſſertions bee directly contradictory, he holds them both to be true, and takes up an hymne of <hi>Omnia bene</hi> to them both.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Firſt, he ſheweth that the Church ſaith right, in this manner: <hi>Although</hi>

                  <hi>it be proved, that one dyed in the peace of the Church, and yet it doe afterwards appeare, that in his writings he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a condemned hereſie, and continuing in that hereſie died there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and but diſſemblingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with the Church, the holy Church uſeth to condemne ſuch a man, jure, even by right.</hi> Having ſaid as much as can bee wiſhed, on the Churches part, the Cardinall will now teach, <hi>that the Pope alſo ſaith right,</hi> in this manner; <hi>Pope Vigilius</hi>

                  <hi>had many worthy reaſons for his defence of the Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by his Conſtitution; and among thoſe worthy reaſons this is one: for if this were once admitted, that a man who dyeth in the communion of the Church, might after his death be condemned; pateret oſtium, this would open ſuch a gap, that every eccleſiaſticall writer, though hee dyed in the Catholike Communion, may yet after his death, out of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings be condemned for an heretike.</hi> Thus <hi>Baronius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. O what a <hi>golden</hi> and bleſſed age was this, that brought forth ſuch a Cardinall! The Church decreeth, that a man after his death, <hi>may</hi> noviter <hi>be condemned</hi> for an heretike; and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth aright: The Pope decreeth the quite contrary, <hi>that no man after his death may</hi> noviter <hi>be condemned</hi> for an heretike; and hee alſo decreeth aright, and with good reaſon. So both the <hi>Church ſaith well,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Pope ſaith well;</hi> &amp; you can ſay no leſſe then, <hi>Et vitula tu dignus, &amp; hic:</hi> or becauſe the Cardinall ſaith <hi>better</hi> than they both; and, what <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe could never doe, makes <hi>two contradictory ſayings</hi> to be both true, and both ſaid well; hee beſt deſerveth, let him have all the prize, <hi>Vitula tu dignus utrâque.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. I told you before, and this enſuing treatiſe will make it as cleare as the Sunne, that <hi>Baronius</hi> having once loſt the path, &amp; forſaken that truth, where only ſure footing was to be found, wandreth up and downe, in and out in this cauſe, as in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, treading on nothing but thornes, wherewith feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe prickt, he skips hither and thither for ſuccour, but ſtill lights on briars and brambles, which doe not onely gall, but ſo intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle him, that by no meanes he can ever extricate, or unwinde
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7680:38"/> himſelfe; for if one liſted to make ſport with the Cardinall, it clearly and certainly followeth, that if the Church <hi>ſay true,</hi> then the Pope ſaying the contrary, doth <hi>ſay untrue.</hi> Againe, if the Pope <hi>ſay true,</hi> then the Church ſaying the contrary, doth <hi>ſay untrue;</hi> and then upon the Cardinals <hi>ſaying that they both ſay true,</hi> it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly followeth, that neither of them both ſay true, and yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that both of them, ſay both <hi>true and untrue,</hi> and yet that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them both ſaith either <hi>truth, or untruth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. But leaving the Cardinall in theſe bryars, ſeeing by the upright, and unpartiall judgement of the whole Catholike Church of all ages, we have proved the Popes decree herein to be erroneous, and (becauſe it is in <hi>a cauſe of faith</hi>) heretical, let us a little examine the two reaſons on which <hi>Vigilius</hi> groundeth this his aſſertion: The former is taken from thoſe words of our Saviour,<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18.</note> 
                  <hi>whatſoever ye binde on earth,</hi> whence, as you have ſeene, <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and, as he ſaith, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> alſo collecteth, that ſuch as are not on earth or alive, cannot be judged by the Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The anſwer is not hard; our Saviours words, being well conſidered, are ſo farre from concluding, what <hi>Vigilius</hi> or <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> or both, doe thence collect, that they clearly and certainly doe enforce the quite contrary; for he ſaid not, Whatſoever yee binde, or looſe, concerning thoſe that are on earth, or living; in which ſenſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> tooke them: but, Whatſoever concerning either the <hi>living</hi> or <hi>dead,</hi> ye my <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and your <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> being upon earth, or during your life time, ſhall binde or looſe, the ſame according to your cenſure here paſſed upon earth, ſhall by my authority bee ratified in heaven. The reſtrictive termes <hi>[upon earth]</hi> are referred to the parties, who doe binde, or looſe; not to the parties, who are bound, or looſed. The generall terme <hi>[whatſoever]</hi> is referred to the parties who are bound, or looſed, whether they be dead, or alive, not to the parties who binde or looſe, who are onely alive, and upon earth. Nor doth our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſay, Whatſoever yee ſeeme to binde or looſe here upon earth, ſhall bee bound or looſed in heaven; for, <hi>(eccleſiae clave errante)</hi> no cenſure doth, or can either binde, or looſe, either the quicke or the dead: but he ſaith, Whatſoever ye doe binde or looſe, if the party be once truly and really bound, or looſed, by you that are upon earth, it ſhall ſtand firme, and bee ratified by my ſelfe in heaven. So the parties who doe binde, or looſe, are the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and their <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> onely while they are upon earth: the parties who are bound, or looſed, are any whoſoever whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>alive</hi> or <hi>dead;</hi> the partie who ratifieth their act in binding and looſing, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe in heaven; For I ſay unto you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever yee looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This expoſition is clearly warranted by the judgement of the whole catholike Church, which, as we have before declared, both beleeved, taught, and practiſed this authority of binding,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7680:39"/> and looſing, not onely upon the living, but upon the dead alſo. Of their binding the nocent, wee have alleaged before abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of examples: for their looſing the innocent, that one of <hi>Flavianus</hi> is ſufficient. <hi>The Epheſine</hi>

Now after the reaſons of <hi>Vigilius</hi> fully refuted, in ſtead of a concluſion, I will adde one ſhort conſideration to all that hath beene ſaid, That this poſition decreed by <hi>Vigilius</hi> is ſuch, as doth not onely condemne the catholike church, that is, all the oppugners of it, but even <hi>Vigilius</hi> himſelfe, and all who defend it. Say you, that a dead man may not <hi>noviter</hi> be condemned? In ſaying ſo you condemne the holy Councell at <hi>Sardica,</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for they all did <hi>noviter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne ſuch perſons being dead, as in their lives time had not beene condemned. Now the holy Fathers of thoſe Councels, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus condemned the dead, dyed themſelves in the Lord, and were in peace gathered to the Lord. If you ſay, they ſhould not have condemned the dead, even in ſaying ſo you doe <hi>noviter</hi> condemne all thoſe Fathers being now dead; and ſo you doe that ſame thing, which you ſay muſt not bee done; and even by defending your poſition, you overthrow your owne poſition; for you doe <hi>noviter</hi> condemne all thoſe holy Fathers being dead; and yet you ſay, that no man may <hi>noviter</hi> condemne the dead: Nay, you condemne not them only, but even your own ſelfe alſo herein, for you condemne thoſe, who condemne the dead, and yet your ſelfe condemnes all thoſe holy Fathers, being now dead; and you condemne them for doing that, which your ſelfe now doe; even for condemning the dead. Such a ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord there is in this hereticall poſition of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> that it not only ſights againſt the truth, and the oppoſites unto it; but viper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, even againſt it ſelfe, and againſt the favourers, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7680:42"/> communion of the Church: both the Emperour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell witneſſe his doctrinall errour herein: truly teaching, that though an heretike live all his life time; not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned by the Church, but in all outward pompe, honour, and applauſe of the Church; either himſelfe cunningly cloaking, or the Church not curiouſly, and warily obſerving his hereſie while hee liveth; yet ſuch a man neither lives, nor dyes in the intire peace and communion of the Church. The Church hath ſuch peace with none, who have not peace with God; nor communion with any, who have not union with Chriſt. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him not, becauſe, as it teacheth others, ſo it ſelfe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt charitably of all: It judged him to be ſuch, as hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and profeſſed himſelfe to bee.

Shee now denounceth a double anathema againſt him, condemning him firſt for beleeving or teaching hereſie, and then for covering his hereſie under the viſor of a Catholike, and of the Catholike faith. So juſtly and fully doth the Emperour, and Councell refute, both the perſonall errour of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in that hee affirmeth <hi>Theodorus</hi> to have dyed in the peace of the Church; and the doctrinall alſo, in that he affirmeth it upon this ground, that in his life time hee was not condemned by the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had juſt, and worthy reaſons to defend this <hi>firſt Chapter:</hi> one of which is this, becauſe, if this were once admitted that one dying in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, might after his death be condemned for an heretike; <hi>pateret oſtium,</hi> there would a gap be opened, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very eccleſiaſticall writer, <hi>licet in communione Catholica defunctus eſſet; although hee dyed in the communion of the Catholike Church,</hi> might after death be out of his writings condemned, for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike; truly hee feareth where no feare is at all. This gap, nay, this gate and broad ſtreet of condemning the dead hath laine wide open this ſixteen hundred years. Can the Cardinall, or any of his friends in all theſe ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ages, wherin have dyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand millions of Catholikes; can he name or finde but ſo much as <hi>one</hi> who hath truly dyed in the peace and communion of the Church, and yet hath beene after his death condemned by the Catholike Church for an heretike? He cannot. The Church ſhould condemne her owne ſelfe, if ſhee condemned any with whom ſhe had peace, and whom ſhe embraceth in her holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which is no other but the ſociety with God. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may dye in ſome errour, yea, in an errour of faith, as <hi>Papias,

               <p n="16">16. But what Church I pray you is that in the communion whereof the Cardinall aſſures us <hi>Theodorus</hi> to have dyed? you may bee ſure it is their Romane: for in the Cardinalls idiome thats not onely <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the Church, but its the <hi>one and onely Church.</hi> In the communion then of their Romane church, even in the communion with the Cardinall himſelfe dyed <hi>Theodorus.</hi> Now its certaine, he died not in the communion of the Church, which was in the fift generall Councell, for they utterly diſclaim him, accurſe him, and call them lyars, and ſlanderers, that ſay hee dyed in their communion.

Seeing then <hi>Theodorus</hi> dyed not in the communion of this Church, which is the true and truly catholike Church, and yet dyed as the Cardinall aſſures you if the communion of their Romane church, it doth clearly and certainly hence enſue, that their Romane church is neither the true catholike, neither hath full communion with the true catholike Church.</p>

Whence two things may be obſerved, the one, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> was not onely accounted, and by name condemned for an heretike, as by other catholiks, ſo by the Emperors alſo, but that this particular condemning was conſonant to the decree of the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Synode, this being nothing elſe but an explanation of that, which they in generall termes had ſet down, and a corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſame: The other, that ſeeing this Imperiall decree, hath ſtood ever ſince the inacting thereof in force and unrepea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by vertue of it; had it beene, or were it as yet, I ſay not rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, but duly, and juſtly put in execution, not any one defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> no not Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> himſelfe, nor any who defends his <hi>Apoſtolicall conſtitution,</hi> (and thoſe are all the members of the preſent Romane church) not one of them, ſhold either have beene heretofore, or be now tolerated, in any city, ſuburbs, towne, village, or field; but beſides the eccleſiaſticall, cenſures and anathemaes, denounced againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and catholike church, they ſhould endure, if no ſharper edge of the civill ſword, yet, perpetuall baniſhment out of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common-wealths, with loſſe and confiſcation of all their goods.</p>
               <p n="16">16. After this Imperiall Law was once publiſhed, the name and credit of <hi>Theodorus</hi> (whoſe memory the Emperors had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and forbidden) grew into a generall contempt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, whereof the church of <hi>Mopſveſtia,</hi> where hee had beene Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, gave a memorable example.

But in <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> time, and perhaps before, though leſſe eagerly, the Neſtorians began afreſh, to renew the memory and doctrine of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> ſetting now a fairer gloſſe and varniſh on their cauſe, then ever they had before: for they very gladly apprehending and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe (to ſay the leaſt) inconſiderate ſpeeches of the Popes Legates, &amp; <hi>Maximus</hi> in the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that by his dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or Epiſtle, <hi>Ibas</hi> was declared to be a catholike, hereupon they now boaſted, that the holy Councell, by approving that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of <hi>Ibas,</hi> had approved, both the perſon and doctrine of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> ſeeing they both are highly extolled, and defended in that Epiſtle. By this meanes was this cauſe brought <hi>ab inferis</hi> the ſecond time, upon the ſtage, and that alſo cloaked under the name, and credit of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> And at this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7680:50"/> boute, all the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and among them Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as Generall to them all, undertooke the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Theodorus:</hi> and, as if there had never beene any ſentence of condemnation, either in generall, or in particular denounced againſt him, even in his definitive, and <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> conſtitution declareth, That <hi>Theodorus</hi> was not condemned, either by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Councels, or Fathers; and this he declareth after his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, circumſpective, and moſt diligent examination of their writings.</p>
               <p n="20">20. What thinke you was become of the Popes eyes at this time, that he could ſee none of all thoſe condemnations of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> before mentioned? Not the general <hi>anathema</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in which <hi>Theodorus</hi> was involved: not the expreſſe, and particular <hi>anathema</hi> denounced againſt him by <hi>Rambulas,</hi> and <hi>Acatius,</hi> with the Councell of <hi>Armenia:</hi> not the condemnation of him, and his writings by Saint <hi>Proclus,</hi> by S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> by the Church of <hi>Mopſveſtia,</hi> by the Edict of the religious Emperours, by the whole Catholike Church. None of all theſe things were done in a corner; they were all matters of publike notice, and record; obvious to any that did not ſhut their eyes againſt the ſun-ſhine of the truth. But, as I ſaid before, and muſt often ſay, Neſtorianiſme, like <hi>Naaſh</hi> the Ammonite, had put out the Popes right eye, he could ſee nothing with that eye; all that he ſaw in this cauſe, was but a very oblique, and ſiniſter aſpect, as doth now, I hope, fully appeare, but will bee yet much more manifeſt, by that which in the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> wee are next to conſider.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For, as if it were a ſmall matter, not to ſee <hi>Theodorus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the former Councels, and Fathers, (though in a man profeſſing ſo exact and accurate inſpection in any cauſe, ſuch groſſe overſights are not veniall) the Pope ventures one ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the credit of this condemned heretike. Hee could not finde that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was condemned by the former witneſſes: Tuſh, that is nothing, he findes him acquitted by them all: hee findes by <hi>Cyrill,</hi> by <hi>Proclus,</hi> by the Councels of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> yea, by <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> owne law, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> ought not to be condemned. This was indeed a point worthy the Popes owne finding. But withall I muſt tell you, that you alſo ſhall finde one other thing, that Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> having once paſſed the bounds of truth, for defence of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> cares not now if he wade up to the eares, and drowne himſelfe in untruths.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Let us then examine the allegations, which, for proofe of this, the Pope hath found; and begin we, as the Pope doth, with <hi>Cyrill.</hi> In his<note n="m" place="margin">Eam citat Vigi. in Conſt. nu. <hi>173.</hi> &amp; <hi>174.</hi> apud Bar. an. <hi>553.</hi>

Out of which words <hi>Vigilius</hi> affirmeth S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> to teach it to be an injurious and hard matter, repugnant to the Eccleſiaſticall rule, to condemne any that is dead; and then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not a Biſhop, not <hi>Theodorus.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That <hi>Vigilius</hi> beſides divers perſonall, held a doctrinall errour in ſaith, in his defence of the <hi>ſecond Chapter,</hi> which concernes the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> againſt <hi>Cyrill.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was ſome ſhadow of reaſon to thinke, that the former Chapter was a perſonall matter; ſeeing that was indeed moved concerning the perſon of <hi>Theodorus.</hi> But in the two other, there is no pretence, or colour for <hi>Baronius</hi> to ſay, that in them the queſtion, or cauſe was perſonall, and not wholy doctrinall; who in all the fift Councell once doubted of the perſons of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> or <hi>Ibas,</hi> whether they were Catholikes, after their anathematizing of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon?</hi> The onely queſtion about them was, whether the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> againſt <hi>Cyrill</hi> were to bee condemned, which the Pope denyeth, and the holy Councell affirmeth, and whether the Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas</hi> was Orthodoxall, or he by it known to be Orthodoxal, which the Pope affirmeth, and the holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell denyeth. The queſtion about them, no way concerned their perſons, but onely their writings. And it might be a wonder that <hi>Baronius</hi> ſhould have the face to ſay, that the cauſe in theſe <hi>two Chapters</hi> was onely perſonall, if it were not daily ſeene by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that <hi>neceſsitas cogit ad turpia,</hi> were neceſſity enforced the Cardinall to uſe any though never ſo untrue, never ſo unlikely excuſes for <hi>Vigilius.</hi>

There are I confeſſe divers perſonall matters, and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of facts, which concernes both theſe Chapters: and although they were not the controverſies moved, and debated, betwixt the defenders, and the oppugners of thoſe Chapters; yet is it needfull to ſay ſomewhat of them alſo; partly for more illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cauſe of faith, &amp; ſpecially that we may ſee how foully <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> have erred, not onely in doctrinall cauſes, which are more obſcure, but even in thoſe perſonall matters, which had beene eaſie, and obvious, if they had not ſhut their eyes againſt the truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning the <hi>ſecond Chapter,</hi> the Popes decree herein relyeth, and is grounded, on three perſonall points, or matters of fact.

But in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, he proves not himſelfe orthodoxal, by that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he ſaith well, but unconſtant and contrary to himſelfe in overthrowing that which he ſaith well, for if <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings againſt <hi>Cyrill</hi> may not be condemned, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> decreth; then may not the doctrines of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> defended therein be condemned as <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> would ſeeme to doe. <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings and Neſtoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme are inſeparable companions, either both muſt ſtand, or both fall together. Its as impoſſible, and repugnant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domne the one, and deny that the other may be condemned, as to condemne Euticheaniſme, and yet defend the Epheſine latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinie and decree thereof, or condemne Arianiſme, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the <hi>Arimine</hi> Councel. Its the honor of truth, that it never is nor can be diſſonant to any other truth: but hereſie not onely may, but almoſt ever doth fight, not only againſt truth, but againſt it ſelfe, &amp; overthroweth with one hand, or poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what it builds up by another, as in this of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is now apparent.</p>
               <p n="21">21.

                  </note> ſo was it the Popes maine purpoſe to defend the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> againſt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which was the <hi>ſecond Chapter.</hi> This is &amp; muſt ſtand for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; cathedrall reſolution of the Pope in this matter: what he ſpeaks repugnant to this is caſuall, &amp; <hi>praeter,</hi> nay <hi>contra intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, its againſt his mind &amp; purpoſe;</hi> its to be thought onely by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incogitancy to have ſlipt from his pen. So his condemning of the Neſtorian doctrine is but in ſhew, its onely verball, his defining that <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings which maintaine Neſtorianiſme may not be condemned, is the true purpoſe and intent of his mind, its cordial &amp; real. By his verball condemning of Neſtorianiſme, he ſhuts it out in words, or as you may ſay at the foregate of his pallace, By his defining that <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, he puls in Neſtorianiſme with all his might, &amp; ſets wide open a poſtren gate unto it: by condemning Neſtorianiſme in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7680:62"/> ſhew of words, he ſeemes to be orthodoxall, by defending Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianiſme indeed and in truth, he demonſtrates himſelfe to be hereticall. Or becauſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> was ſo very wiſe a Pope as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after out of <hi>Baronius</hi> you ſhall heare, it ſeemes he meant to ſhew one part of his wiſedome, and policie, in this matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> comes in his owne naturall habit, or in the liverie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> away with it, the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe will not admit it, hee cannot abide it: but when it comes countenanced, and graced, with the name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and in his liverie, the Pope embraceth it in both his armes, and by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authoritie commandeth all men, to give moſt friendly welcome and entertainement unto it.</p>
               <p n="22">22 You have now the judgement, and cathedrall reſolution of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> touching this <hi>ſecond Chapter,</hi> that the hereticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> againſt <hi>Cyril,</hi> and the Catholike faith may not bee condemned.

               <p n="24">24. The other reaſon of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> is, becauſe it were a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, injury and ſlander, againſt <hi>Theodoret,</hi> to condemne his writings. This the Pope<note n="x" place="margin">Vigil. Conſt. nu. <hi>182.</hi>

               <p n="25">25.

               <p n="26">26. But ſay indeed: Is it an injurie, a ſlander, a diſgrace to one, that his errors ſhould either by himſelfe, or by the Church be condemned?

                  <hi>his image in a Chariot, and with great pompe, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hymnes, brought it in triumphant manner into the City of Cyrus,</hi> where <hi>Sergius</hi> a Neſtorian, and Biſhop of that place, mentioned in a Collect <hi>Theodorus</hi> of Mopſveſtia, <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> as three of their principall Neſtorian Saints: was it not now high time to wipe away that blemiſh from the name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and to condemne thoſe writings of his which gave occaſion to the Neſtorians to make ſuch boaſts?</p>
               <p n="31">31. I appeale now unto any man, whether their condemning of <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings, did not much more tend to the honour, then, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> fancieth, to the ſlander, and diſgrace of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. As it is a blemiſh to a man to retaine a filthy ſpot in his garment, but the taking of it away doth grace, and make him more comely; even ſo the name of <hi>Theodoret</hi> was ſtained by thoſe writings; they emboldened the Neſtorians to put him in their curſed Calender; but by the condemning of thoſe writings was the ſtaine and blemiſh wiped away from his perſon, his name, and honour was vindicated from the Neſtorians, and brought, as it well deſerved, to the holy Church of GOD; nothing of <hi>Theodoret</hi> left for heretikes to vaunt of, but the onely ſtaines of <hi>Theodoret;</hi> nothing but thoſe hereticall writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and accurſed, both by <hi>Theodoret</hi> himſelfe, and by the whole Church of God.</p>
               <p n="32">32. No, no; it is Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> (and ſuch as applaud his decree for infallible) that diſgraceth, and moſt ignominiouſly uſeth the name, perſon, and memory of <hi>Theodoret:</hi> By his decree thoſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which, by the Churches ſentence of condemnation are quite dulled, receive full ſtrength, and vigour for the Neſtorians againſt Catholikes: By him the Neſtorians
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7680:65"/> have an eternall charter, and irrevocable decree, that <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings againſt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and with them the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> ought not to be taxed, nor condemned. His <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is a triumphant chariot for them to ſet the Image of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> in their Temples, and with Anthemes and Collects to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize, yea adore him in their Maſſes, among their hereticall Saints. But for the Church of God, I conſtantly affirme they could not poſſibly have more honoured <hi>Theodoret,</hi> than by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the hay and ſtubble of his writings, the condemning of which the Pope decreeth to bee an injury and ſlander unto him.</p>
               <p n="33">33. May wee now in the laſt place conſider a little what might be the intendment of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in pleading, and decreeing this for <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings? I doubt not but the love he bare to Neſtorianiſme might make him zealous for thoſe writings, which are the bulwarks of the Neſtorians: but <hi>non ſunt in eo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> Popes are men of profound thoughts, and very long rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; they have deepe, and myſticall projects in their decrees. <hi>Vigilius</hi> had, and it may be principally, an eye to this his owne, and all their <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Conſtitutions like unto it: If the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> may not be condemned, becauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was a Catholike, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> this decree of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hereticall, may not bee condemned, becauſe the Pope is the head of all Catholikes. If it bee an injury, and a ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> to taxe him, or his name, by condemning his writings; it muſt much more be an injury, and ſlander, nay, that is nothing, even a blaſphemy and ſinne irremiſſible to taxe the Popes Holineſſe, by condemning his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> decree: If you preſume to condemne, nay, but taxe them, or their names, though their decrees ſhall bee as apparently hereticall, as are thoſe writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> you are condemned for ever as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, as contumelious, as ſlandering perſons.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſpeaking againſt this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> firſt makes it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whoſe it is, ſaying<note n="l" place="margin">Bar. an. <hi>432.</hi> nu. <hi>71.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. In the time of the Epheſine Councell, there was, as all know, an exceeding breach betwixt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> with other Catholike Biſhops, who condemned <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with divers other Eaſtern Biſhops, who tooke part with <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> againſt the holy Councell.

Of ſuch Catholikes their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church hath great ſtore; nay, ſeeing none is now of their Church, who approves not all the Cathedrall decrees of their Popes, and therefore this of <hi>Vigilius</hi> among the reſt, it hence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, that none is now a Romane Catholike, that is, a member of their preſent Romane Church, who approves not <hi>Ibas,</hi> ſuch as he was when he writ this Epiſtle, for a Catholike, that is, who approves not the moſt blaſphemous heretikes, and oppugners of the whole faith, to be Catholikes, and who condemnes not the <hi>Cyrillians,</hi> that is, all that maintaine the Catholike faith, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</p>

               <p n="15">15. The Neſtorians being loth to forſake, or have it thought that any of them did forſake their hereſies, and being withall moſt deſperately given to lying and ſlandering, ſet forth a forme of union, forged by themſelves, wherein they made <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and all who conſented to him, that is, all Catholikes, to condemne their former Catholike doctrine decreed at the Epheſine Synod, and to aſſent to their hereſies. And, as if this had beene the true uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the conditions of peace agreed upon betwixt <hi>Cyrill</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> they every where buzzed this into the eares of their ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſpred abroad the copies thereof, triumphing in it, that now they had wonne the field, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> and all his partakers had now conſented to Neſtorianiſme; and that upon this conſent a generall union and peace enſued in the Church. This and no other is the union which <hi>Ibas</hi> in his Epiſtle embraceth, and by conſenting whereunto Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> decreeth, and <hi>Baronius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth <hi>Ibas</hi> to be a Catholike, to which union whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth, or approveth others, conſenting to it; they doe even by that one act, beſides all the reſt, infallibly demonſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not onely to be Neſtorians, and to approve all the hereſies and blaſphemies of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> but to be in the moſt baſe, abject, and low degree of all Neſtorians, even ſuch as by lyes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies ſtrive to uphold their hereſies.</p>

And that you may know what words were written, by the moſt holy Archbiſhop</hi> Iohn, <hi>and what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hee received backe from</hi> Cyrill, <hi>I have to this my writing adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7680:75"/> their very Epiſtles, that your Holineſſe reading them may know, and declare to all our Fathers that love peace, that the contention is now ceaſed, and the partition wall is now taken away, and that they (hee meaneth</hi> Cyrill <hi>and the Catholikes) who had before ſeditiouſly enveied againſt the living</hi> (Neſtorius) <hi>and the dead</hi> (Theodorus) <hi>are now confounded, making ſatisfaction for their faults, &amp; contraria do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes ſuae priori doctrinae, and now teach the contrarie to their former doctrine. For none now dare ſay, that there is one nature</hi> (that is, one naturall ſubſiſtence or perſon) <hi>of the divinity and humanity, but they confeſſe and beleeve, both in the temple, and in him who dwelleth in the temple, who is one Sonne, Ieſus Chriſt. And this I have written to your Sanctitie, out of that great affection which I beare to you, knowing that your holineſſe doth exerciſe it ſelfe, night and day, in the doctrine of God, that you might be profitable unto many.</hi> Thus farre are the words of <hi>Ibas,</hi> written unto <hi>Maris</hi> an hereticke<note n="n" place="margin">Ad Marin Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, haereticum.

               <p n="20">20. In which words any who hath though but halfe an eye of a Catholike, cannot chuſe but clearely diſcerne, the very poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and malice of all the hereſies, and practiſes of the Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to be condenſate and compact together. Firſt, here is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their maine hereſie, that Chriſt is not God, as the houſe is not the man who dwelleth in the houſe. Secondly, is ſet downe a notorious ſlander againſt <hi>Cyrill</hi> and the Catholikes, that they at the union made with <hi>Iohn,</hi> did anathematize all who held one naturall ſubſiſtence, or one perſon to be in Chriſt, that is, in effect did accurſe all Catholikes, and the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Faith. Thirdly, it is a notable untruth, that <hi>Cyril</hi> made the union with <hi>Iohn</hi> upon this condition, that hee ſhould anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize all who hold Chriſt to be one perſon, the condition was quite contrarie, to wit, that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and they on his part, ſhould anathematize all who denied Chriſt to be one, or who affirmed him to be two perſons. Fourthly, it is a ſlander, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> writ an Epiſtle to that effect, as if he aſſented to that condition men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Ibas.</hi> The Epiſtle is teſtified by <hi>Cyrill</hi> himſelfe not to bee his, but a counterfaite writing, forged by the Neſtorians. Fiftly, it is a Calumnie, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> and the reſt who condemned <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> were ſeditious perſons: it is as much as to ſay, that the holy Epheſine Councell, was a conſpiracie and ſeditious conventicle. Sixtly, it is an unexcuſable ſlander and untruth, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> and they who held with him, that is, the Catholikes, that they were confounded, and repented of their former doctrines, or writ contrarie unto them. Theſe, beſides
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7680:75"/> divers the like, are the flowers wherewith the latter part of that <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is deckt, even that part which Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> doe ſo magnifie, the one defining, the other defending, that by it <hi>Ibas</hi> ought to be judged a Catholike, and his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> received as Catholike: This part above all the reſt, is ſo ſtuffed with hereſies and ſlanders, that I doe conſtantly affirme, that none of all their Romane Alcumiſts can extract or diſtill one dramme of Catholike doctrine, or any goodneſſe out of it. Only Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> being, as I have often ſaid, blinded with Neſtoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, and Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> being infatuated with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Pontificall <hi>infallible</hi> Chaire, they two by the new found art of Tranſubſtantiating, wherein that ſect excelleth <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> and all the inchanters in the world, they by one ſpell or charme of a few words pronounced out of that holy chaire, can turne a ſerpent into a ſtaffe, bread into a living bodie, darkeneſſe into light, an hereticke into a Catholike, yea the very venome and poyſon of all Neſtorianiſme, into moſt wholſome doctrines of the Catholike faith: ſuch, as that none may write, ſpeake, or thinke ought to the contrarie.</p>
               <p n="21">21. See ye not now, as I foretold that you ſhould, both the Pope; and the Cardinall; marching under the banner of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,</hi> and like two worthy Generalls, holding up a ſtandard to the Neſtorians, and building in the Romane Church, but very cunningly and artificially, a Capitoll for Neſtorianiſme? They forſooth will not in plaine tearmes ſay that Neſtorianiſme is the Catholike faith, that Chriſt is not God, that the Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> is not the Sonne of God, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> is an hereticke, and the holy Epheſine Councell hereticall: Fie, theſe are too <hi>Beoticall,</hi> and blunt, they could never have gotten any one to taſt of that cup of Neſtorianiſme, had they dealt ſo plainely, or ſimply ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> are Schooles of better manners, and of more civilitie and ſubtiltie: you muſt learne there to ſpeake hereſie in the <hi>Atticke Dialect,</hi> in ſmooth, plauſible, ſweet and ſugred tearmes; you muſt ſay the <hi>union</hi> which <hi>Ibas</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> embraceth is the Catholike union, that <hi>Ibas</hi> by embracing that union was a Catholike, and ought to bee judged a Catholike; that whoſoever embraceth not this union, which the Pope hath defined to be the Catholike communion, cannot be a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: or if you ſpeake more briefly and <hi>Laconically,</hi> you may ſay, the Popes decrees and <hi>Cathedrall</hi> judgements in cauſes of faith are infallible. Say but either of theſe, you ſay as much as either <hi>Theodorus</hi> or <hi>Neſtorius</hi> did, you deny Chriſt to bee God; You condemne the Epheſine Councell, you ſpeake true Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſme, but you ſpeake it not after the rude and ruſticke faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in that pureſt Ciceronian phraſe which is now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined language of the Romane Church. By approving this union, or the Popes decree in this cauſe of <hi>Ibas,</hi> you drinke up at once all the blaſphemies and hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> even the very dregs

Why then muſt the latter, and not the former be approved? Forſooth in the former part<note n="p" place="margin">Vid. Epiſt. Jba loc. cit.</note> the blaſphemies of the Neſtorians are in too plaine and blunt a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner expreſſed; <hi>Cyrill</hi> is an Apollinarian; The twelve Chapters of <hi>Cirill, omni impietate plena ſunt, are full of all impietie.</hi> The <hi>Epheſine</hi> Councell unjuſtly depoſed <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and approved the twelve Chapters of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which are <hi>contraria verae fidei,</hi> and ſuch like. It is not for a Pope or a Cardinall to approve ſuch plaine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous hereſies; they might as well ſay, We are heretikes, wee are Neſtorians: which kinde of <hi>Beoticiſme</hi> is farre from the civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Romane Court: But in the latter part the hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and all his blaſphemies are offered in the ſhew of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and communion with the Church; and comming under the vaunt of that union, as in the wombe of the Trojane horſe, the Pope and the Cardinall may now with honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; the union (and with, or in it all Neſtorianiſme) muſt be brought into the City, the Pope and the Cardinall will them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves put their hands to this holy worke, <hi>pedibuſque rotarum ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ijciunt lapſus, &amp; ſtupea vincula collo intendunt,</hi> themſelves will drag and hale it with their owne ſhoulders to within the wals: nor is that enough, it muſt be placed in the very Romane Capitoll, in the holy temple, and conſecrated to God, and that the Pope himſelfe will doe by an <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> and infallible conſtitution: by that immutable decree is this union ſet up as the Catholike union, <hi>Et monſtrum infoelix ſacrata ſiſtitur arce;</hi> this unholy and unhappy union is now embraced, by which all the gates of the City of God are ſet wide open for all hereſies to ruſh in at their pleaſure, and make havocke of the Catholike ſaith.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Now it is not unworthy our labour to conſider whether <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> did in meere ignorance, or wittingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this union mentioned by <hi>Ibas,</hi> that is in truth, all Neſtoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme.

Thus doth the Cardinall play, &amp; ſport himſelfe in contradictions, and as the winde blowes and turnes him, ſo doth he turne his note al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: If the winde blow to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and turne the Cardinals face towards <hi>Cyrill,</hi> then the union is hereticall, leſt <hi>Cyrill</hi> who condemned it, ſhould bee condemned for an heretike. If the winde blow from <hi>Africke,</hi> and turne the Cardinals face towards <hi>Rome</hi> and Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> then the union is Catholike, leſt <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> approving this union, ſhould not be thought a Catholike. Or becauſe a Cardinall ſo learned, ſo renouned as <hi>Baronius,</hi> may not be thought to contradict himſelfe, or ſpeake amiſſe in either place, let both ſayings be admitted for true, and then it unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably followeth, that by the Cardinals divinity, and in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Neſtorianiſme is the Catholike faith; which aptly and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily will accord both his ſayings, for ſo the author of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> by approving this union ſhall be a perfect Neſtorian, as in the one place is affirmed; and by approving this union ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a perfect Catholike, as in the other place is avouched.</p>

               <p n="35">35. The ſecond is, the occaſion which the Neſtorians tooke for their pretended calumnie: They knew that <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Biſhops had written to <hi>Cyrill,</hi> willing him to condemne his owne Chapters; yea, that they had writ ſo reſolutely, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Cyrill</hi> did ſo, they would not conſent unto any peace, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus much was true, as by the letter of <hi>Acatius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> to <hi>Cyrill</hi> is evident: Now they ſaw that <hi>Cyrill</hi> afterwards, and in that very yeare conſented with <hi>Iohn,</hi> and made union with him, whereupon they boaſted that <hi>Cyrill</hi> did it upon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required by <hi>Iohn</hi> at the firſt, which was the condemning of his former doctrine; wilfully and maliciouſly concealing both how <hi>Cyrill</hi> utterly denyed to yeeld unto them, or to that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required by them; and how at the length <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſo many of them as were received into communion, conſented whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him, and ſubſcribed to the Catholike faith.

               <p n="37">37. In which narration of the Cardinall, beſides many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths wherewith it is ſtuffed, there are two things, above all the reſt, to be obſerved. The former is, how wiſe and politike the Cardinall doth make <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the whole Synod of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to be in this matter of the union: firſt, they condemne the hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> approve the Epheſine Councell, and by ſo doing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the twelve Chapters of <hi>Cyrill;</hi> they doe this in a Synod, and publiſh their Synodall decree at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and other places, to ſhew and teſtifie themſelves to bee truly ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall; and when all this is done, they labour earneſtly, with <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> to make him condemne his owne twelve Chapters, which is in effect to maintaine Neſtorianiſme; to condemne the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine Councell, (wherein his Chapters were approved) yea, to condemne their owne Synodall decree, by which themſelves, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> had condemned <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and approved the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Cyrill.</hi> Againe, he makes <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his Synod to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with <hi>Sixtus,</hi> with <hi>Maximianus,</hi> with all other Catholikes ſave <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and them of his Patriarchſhip; with all the former they will communicate, though they all approved the twelve Chapters of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> with <hi>Cyril</hi> they will not communicate, unleſſe he will condemne the ſame twelve Chapters. If they thought the twelve Chapters to be hereticall, why hold they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Sixtus, Maximianus,</hi> and others who approved them? nay, why did themſelves approve them? If they thought them orthodoxall, why would they (being themſelves orthodoxall) perſwade, yea, enforce and wring out of <hi>Cyrill</hi> a condemnation of the orthodoxall faith? Beſides, what a worthy peece of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was this, which the Cardinall doth faſten upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all the reſt? he makes them to ſend <hi>Paulus,</hi> a reverend Biſhop, with a letter purpoſely to be delivered to <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which teſtified their Synodall, and willing conſent in approving the twelve Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that is, of the Catholike faith, and yet command <hi>Paulus</hi> to urge and wring from <hi>Cyrill,</hi> if he could, a condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe twelve Chapters, that is, of the whole Catholike faith? What deepe diſſemblers and hypocrites doth hee make <hi>Iohn, Paul,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe orthodoxall Biſhops? Laſtly, of what faith or religion, doe you thinke, muſt <hi>Iohn, Paul,</hi> and the reſt be, by the Cardinals narration. By their Synodall ſentence, and holy confeſſion therein; they appove the twelve Chapters
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7680:80"/> of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and ſo are perfect Catholikes; againe, by their urging of <hi>Cyrill</hi> to condemne his twelve Chapters, they are perfect Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, for the condemning of them, is the defending of all the Neſtorian hereſies; ſo, by the Cardinals divinity, they are at the ſelfe ſame time, both perfect Neſtorians, and perfect Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes; which can no way be effected, but by admitting the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals old poſition, which he learned of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> that perfect Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianiſme is the perfect Catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Into ſuch labyrinths doth the Cardinals foule miſrepor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this matter leade, and even draw a man; whereas the truth, as, by that which formerly hath beene declared, is evident, that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the reſt of the Synod, when they vrged <hi>Cyrill</hi> to condemne his Chapters, had not made that Synodall decree for condemning of <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> &amp; when they had once made that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, they never, either by word or writing, urged <hi>Cyrill</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe Chapters: Before they made that decree, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> they were hereticall, and held communion neither with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> nor <hi>Sixtus,</hi> nor any other Catholikes: After they had made that decree, and condemned <hi>Neſtorius</hi> with his hereſies, they were orthodoxall, &amp; communicated no leſſe with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with <hi>Sixtus,</hi> or any other Catholike; nay, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated firſt of all with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> &amp; then with all other Catholikes.</p>
               <p n="39">39. The other point to bee obſerved out of the Cardinalls words, is, that by his narration <hi>Cyrill</hi> did indeed, as <hi>Ibas</hi> and the Neſtorians ſlandered him, renounce &amp; reject the Catholike faith, for the Cardinall makes <hi>Paulus</hi> of <hi>Emiſa</hi> but to goe once to <hi>Alexandria</hi> about the union, or if any can finde in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall a ſecond journey thither, yet by his narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Synodall Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the reſt, wherein they condemne <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and ſet downe an orthodoxall profeſſion, that Epiſtle was ſent by <hi>Paulus</hi> at the firſt time, for he had withall in charge to urge <hi>Cyrill</hi> to condemne his twelve Chapters, which at his laſt going had beene abſurd and incongruous. So then the Epiſtle which <hi>Paulus,</hi> at his firſt going to <hi>Cyrill</hi> brought with him, was the orthodoxall Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Synod. Now it is certaine by the expreſſe words of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that the letter which <hi>Iohn</hi> and the reſt, ſent by <hi>Paulus</hi> at his firſt going, was rejected by <hi>Cyrill,</hi> for he ſaith of that Epiſtle, <hi>hujuſmodi epiſtolas non accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavi, I did not accept this Epiſtle ſent by</hi> Paul: and the Cardinall<note n="t" place="margin">Bar. an. <hi>432.</hi> nu. <hi>66.</hi>
                  </note> citing thoſe words of <hi>Cyrill verbatim,</hi> and making ſome prettie collection out of them, could not be ignorant hereof. Seing then by the Cardinalls narration, the Epiſtle which <hi>Paulus</hi> brought at his firſt comming, was orthodoxall, and ſeeing it is certaine that <hi>Cyrall</hi> rejected that Epiſtle, which <hi>Paulus</hi> at his firſt comming brought from <hi>Iohn,</hi> it inevitably followeth, upon the Cardinalls narration, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> indeed rejected an ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall and Catholike profeſſion, containing the condemnation of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and his hereſies, and therefore that <hi>Cyrill</hi> renounced
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7680:81"/> his former Catholike doctrine, &amp; conſented to Neſtorianiſme, which is the ſame calumnie wherewith <hi>Ibas</hi> in his impious <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> ſlandereth <hi>Cyrill.</hi> And although <hi>Baronius</hi> doe in words deny this, as I know hee doth, yet conſidering the deepe projects which the Cardinall hath, it may bee feared, that he meant by this meanes, cunningly, and cloſely, to lay a foundation to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that union, in which <hi>Ibas</hi> in his Epiſtle rejoyceth, and which <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the Cardinall himſelfe approve for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or if the Cardinall intended not this, yet I am ſure that hee hath then unwittingly deviſed, ſuch a notable ground, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that ſlander, which <hi>Ibas</hi> imputeth to <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that at the time of the union he rejected his former doctrines, as that neither <hi>Ibas</hi> himſelfe, nor any of the old Neſtorians could poſſibly have for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged a more faire and colourable pretence for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="40">40. My concluſion now of this their former reaſon, for defence of the impious <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Ibas;</hi> drawne from the <hi>union</hi> mentioned therein, is this: Seeing that <hi>union</hi> mentioned and approved by <hi>Ibas</hi> in the later part of his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> is no other but the <hi>union</hi> in Neſtorianiſme, unto which hee malitiouſly ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth <hi>Cyrill</hi> to have conſented: and ſeeing Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> not onely approve as Catholike, the union there mentioned by <hi>Ibas,</hi> but prove by it and conſenting to it, both <hi>Ibas</hi> himſelfe to bee a Catholike, and his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> in that part at leaſt, to be orthodoxall, it hence cleerely enſueth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſentence defineth, and <hi>Baronius</hi> by name (as alſo all who maintaine the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> ſentence in cauſes of faith to bee <hi>infallible) doe all defend Neſtorianiſme to be the Catholike union, and ſo; Neſtorianiſme to bee the Catholike faith:</hi> which whoſoever affirmes, are by the judgement not onely of the fift, but the fourth and third generall Councells, <hi>convicted, condemned,</hi> and <hi>anathematized heretickes.</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7680:84"/> incarnate, and aſſumed the manhood to make one perſon with the Godhead, but all that they meant was, that the Son of God, was onely by affection, and love united unto the ſonne of <hi>Marie,</hi> being already perfect man in the wombe of his mother, and that God was borne of her, not by aſſuming fleſh unto him, but by inhabiting that man who tooke fleſh of her. Thus in ſhew of words the Neſtorians ſeemed to bee Catholikes, and to ſay the ſame with Catholikes, but their ſenſe and meaning in thoſe words was moſt hereticall, and therefore indeed and in truth themſelves notwithſtanding all theſe ſpeeches, were heretikes.</p>

If it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that this was indeed the meaning of <hi>Ibas</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> then will thoſe words of his profeſſion, be ſo farre from proving either him or his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to be Catholike, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> doe thence inferre, that it will demonſtrate both <hi>Ibas</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that profeſſion, and <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> in defending it, to approve and maintaine Neſtorianiſme as the onely Catholike Faith.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But can this thinke you be ſhewed indeed? It may: and that moſt clearly, and moſt certainely.

Or how could he have commended <hi>Theodorus,</hi> for a teacher of the truth, who denies the perſonall, and holds onely an affectuall unitie of thoſe <hi>two natures,</hi> had <hi>Ibas</hi> meant that there had beene a true perſonall and Hypoſtaticall union of them? Take the words in the Neſtorian ſenſe, there is a perfect harmonie in the whole <hi>Epiſtle:</hi> take them in the orthodoxall ſenſe, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will then jarre from the middle and end, this makes a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the whole writing, yea, it makes the profeſſion of <hi>Ibas</hi> to fight with the maine ſcope and purpoſe of <hi>Ibas.</hi>

               <p n="27">27. That one place in the end of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> concerning the <hi>union,</hi> makes this moſt evident, <hi>Ibas</hi> ſaith that among other things <hi>Paulus Emiſenus</hi> required, and <hi>Cyrill</hi> conſented to anathematize thoſe who profeſſe, <hi>quia una natura eſt divinitatis, &amp; humanitatis, that there is one nature of the deitie and humanitie in Chriſt.</hi> Had <hi>Ibas</hi> by one nature, meant one eſſence, ſo that both the humanitie, and deitie were one eſſence, why ſhould they require <hi>Cyrill</hi> to anathematize that? for neither <hi>Cyrill,</hi> nor any Catholike ever affirmed there was onely one nature, that is, one onely eſſence in Chriſt. But by <hi>nature, Ibas</hi> underſtood Perſon, and ſo its true that <hi>Cyrill</hi> taught one nature, that is, one onely perſon in Chriſt, whereas <hi>Neſtorius, Ibas</hi> and all the Neſtorians affirmed <hi>two ſuch Natures,</hi> that is, <hi>two perſons</hi> to be in Chriſt: according to which ſenſe <hi>Ibas</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Paulus</hi> dealing with <hi>Cyrill</hi> to yeeld to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianiſme, and on the behalfe of the Neſtorians, required him to anathematize thoſe who ſay there is but one <hi>Nature,</hi> that is, but <hi>one perſon</hi> in Chriſt: and he ſlanderouſly adds, that <hi>Cyrill</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:7680:87"/> conſented ſo to do: that is, that he ſubſcribed indeed to all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianiſme, and renounced the Catholike faith, the decree of the Epheſine Councell, and his owne twelve Chapters.

An undeniable proofe, not onely that the profeſſion of <hi>Ibas</hi> made therein of two natures and one perſon, is hereticall, but that <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> for this very point are anathematized by the whole Church, becauſe they defend that profeſſion in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> as Catholike and orthodoxall, which by ſo many, ſo evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, and even by the conſenting judgement of the whole Church, is condemned for hereticall. And this I hope may ſuffice to explaine or illuſtrate the Popes meaning in the Poſition or concluſion which he undertakes to prove in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>Ibas</hi> was a Catholike, in making this ſo orthodoxall, and Catholike a profeſſion in his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> of two natures and one perſon.</p>

So either muſt <hi>Vigilius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all Neſtorians for Catholikes, if this reaſon for <hi>Ibas</hi> bee effectuall, or if they bee truly heretickes, whom <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> yet hath condemned, as well as <hi>Ibas,</hi> then is this his reaſon ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to prove from the condemnation of <hi>Dioſcorus, Ibas</hi> or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be Catholike.</p>
               <p n="30">30. His ſecond reaſon is drawne from the likeneſſe and iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of faith in <hi>Flavianus,</hi> and <hi>Ibas, damnat</hi>

                  <hi>quoque propter du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum naturarum vocem,</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>did alſo, or for the ſame cauſe, condemne Flavianus,</hi> for which <hi>Ibas</hi> was condemned, to wit, for profeſſing two natures in Chriſt. Seeing then it is knowne, that the profeſſion of <hi>Flavianus</hi> was Catholike, the profeſſion alſo of <hi>Ibas</hi> made in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> being like to that of <hi>Flavianus,</hi> muſt needes be Catholike; My annotation on this reaſon of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is, that it is inconſequent, ſophiſticall, and worth nothing at all, <hi>Ibas</hi> indeede in words ſaid the like with <hi>Flavianus,</hi> but <hi>Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> ſaid it in a Chatholike ſenſe, holding thoſe two natures to make but one perſon or perſonall ſubſiſtence, and <hi>Ibas</hi> ſaid it in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> in an hereticall ſenſe, holding thoſe two natures to make two diſtinct perſons, or two perſonall ſubſiſtences. To <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorus</hi> it was all one to ſay as <hi>Flavianus</hi> did, or as <hi>Ibas</hi> in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> doth; for ſeeing they both jumpe in this, that two natures or eſſences doe remaine after the incarnation, they are both alike heretickes to <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> though in truth the profeſſion of <hi>Flavianus</hi> made him a Martyr, and the profeſſion of <hi>Ibas,</hi> ſet down in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> being in words the ſame, make him an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke. Or if <hi>Ibas</hi> be a Catholike for profeſſing in words the ſame which <hi>Flavianus</hi> did, then by this reaſon of our Author <hi>Vigilius, Theodorus, Neſtorius,</hi> and all the Neſtorians, are Catholikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

Thus <hi>Vigilius,</hi> to cloake his owne hereſie, would faine faſten it upon the holy Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which was ſo farre from partaking with <hi>Vigilius</hi> herein, that by their definitive ſentence this very<note n="u" place="margin">Tota Epiſtola hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retica eſt.

                  </note> but in truth, two or three yeares at the leaſt after the <hi>union,</hi> as before we have proved. Now I pray you, what a conſequent, or colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction call you this? <hi>Ibas</hi> being ſuſpected of Neſtorianiſme, to cleare himſelfe, conſented to the Epheſine Councell, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to bee a Catholike, ſixteene yeares after the <hi>union,</hi> or thirteene yeares after he writ this <hi>Epiſtle:</hi> therefore at the time of the <hi>union,</hi> and of the writing of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> he was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike alſo, and not a Neſtorian. Why, twelve or ſixteen years might have a ſtrange operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Ibas;</hi> and there is no doubt but ſo it had? In ſo many revolutions <hi>Ibas</hi> ſaw, how both himſelfe and other Neſtorians were publikely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by the Church, and by the Emperour, and hated of all, who had any love to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7680:89"/> Catholike faith: He ſaw that himſelfe was perſonally called <hi>cora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nobis,</hi> for maintaining that hereſie: he knew, that unleſſe hee clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe before thoſe Iudges, deputed by the Emperour to heare and examine his cauſe; he was in danger of the like depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and ſome others had juſtly felt. The ſerious and often meditation of theſe matters wrought effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ibas,</hi> and therefore before <hi>Photius</hi> &amp; <hi>Euſtathius</hi> he renounced, diſclamed, and condemned Neſtorianiſme, and ſo at that time proved himſelfe, by his profeſſion before them, to bee a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as he had before that time, and ſpecially when he writ this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> demonſtrated himſelfe to be, not onely an earneſt, but a malicious and ſlanderous heretike. I cannot illuſtrate the Pope, my Authors reaſon, by a more fit ſimilitude, than of a man once deadly ſicke of the Peſtilence, but afterwards fully cured and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; for <hi>Vigilius</hi> his reaſon is, as if one ſhould ſay, This man was not ſicke of the Peſtilence, no not when the ſore was running upon him, and hee at the very point of death, becauſe ſome twelve or ſixteene yeares after, hee was a ſound man, cleare from all ſuſpition of the Peſtilence. Nor needeth this ſecond reaſon of <hi>Vigilius</hi> any further explanation.</p>
               <p n="34">34. We come now, in the laſt place, to that which <hi>Vigilius</hi> maketh his firſt reaſon in the former text; into which, becauſe hee hath compacted the very venome of the Neſtorians, wee muſt bee inforced to take ſomewhat the more paines, in our Commentary upon it. This reaſon (in which, it ſeems, the Pope puts his greateſt confidence) is drawne from the explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, of which<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vig. Conſt. nu.</hi> 192 193, 194.</note> 
                  <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ibas</hi> at the firſt, &amp; before <hi>Cyrill</hi> had explaned them, miſconceived the meaning of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and therefore ſeemed to ſpeake againſt <hi>Cyrill:</hi> but ſo ſoone as <hi>Cyrill</hi> had explaned them, and decared his owne meaning, then <hi>Ibas,</hi> and all the Eaſterne Biſhops forthwith embraced the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>Cyrill;</hi> and ever after that, <hi>Ibas</hi> continued a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. This <hi>Epiſtle</hi> then of <hi>Ibas,</hi> and profeſſion of faith made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which certainly followed the Explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, muſt needs be Catholike, &amp; declare <hi>Ibas,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he writ it, to have been a Catholike; ſeeing, when he made this confeſſion of faith, and writ this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> he held the ſame faith with <hi>Cyrill;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no doubt held the Catholike faith. This is the full ſumme and effect of the Popes reaſon, taken from the Explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, and for the excellency of it, it ſpreadeth it ſelfe into every part of the two other reaſons alſo, as containing an explication of them, or giving ſtrength unto them; for which cauſe wee are with more diligence and circumſpection to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the pith of it.</p>

               <p n="40">40. The third part of the Popes <hi>Artificium</hi> is his Logicke, which in very truth is nothing elſe but trifling ſophiſtication: he ſuppoſeth that <hi>Cyrills</hi> explanation of the twelve Chapters, was the cauſe and occaſion of the <hi>union</hi> betwixt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and the reſt. It was not, for that was publiſhed, and knowne unto them, more then an whole yeare before the <hi>union:</hi> nay that explanation did more alienate their minds from <hi>Cyrill,</hi> they deteſted that, more then the Chapters themſelves, as we have clearly proved; ſo far was it from effecting the <hi>union,</hi> that it increaſed the breach and diſ-union. The onely true, and certaine cauſe of the union, was the relenting of the Eaſterne Biſhops, from their former ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, obſtinacie, and hereſie: their ſubſcribing to all that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> required of them, to wit, to the condemning of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and his hereſies: till they did this, <hi>Cyrill</hi> was unmoveable, inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any <hi>union:</hi> as ſoone as ever this was done, <hi>Cyrill</hi> moſt gladly embraced them, and ſung his hymne, <hi>Let the heavens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> for their conſenting to the Catholike faith. <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſtill harps on a wrong ſtring, and fallaciouſly puts <hi>non cauſam, pro cauſa,</hi> which was not fitting for the Popes gravitie &amp; judgment.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The fourth and fift which are the chiefe parts of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>Artificium,</hi> concerne his Ethicall, and Theologicall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which being confuſed and mingled together throughout this whole text, and manifeſting the Pope to joyne to his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſlander, I muſt bee forced to handle them both together. Theſe conſiſt in that which the Pope ſo often beats upon, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> explaned his Chapters, and upon that explanation, <hi>Ibas</hi> and the other Eaſterne Biſhops ranne to embrace him, and his communion, what thinke you is that explanation of <hi>Cyrills</hi> Chapters, which the Pope ſo eagerly urgeth, and makes the cauſe of the <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Ibas</hi> and the reſt? Truly thats a myſterie indeed, and containes in it the pith of Neſtorianiſme: <hi>Baronius</hi> was very loath to unfold this ſecret of the Popes Art: but I hope to make it ſo perſpicuous, as that none ſhall bemone the want of the Cardinalls Commentarie in this point.</p>

Now the ſame Neſtorians being no leſſe ſubtle, then malicious: when they ſpake or writ of this matter to any of their owne conſorts, to their <hi>Electi,</hi> one of which this <hi>Maris</hi> was to whom <hi>Ibas</hi> writ, then they ſaid in plaine termes, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> (and the other Catholikes) had recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, condemned; or anathematized his twelve Chapters, and his former doctrine; as in the end of this Epiſtle <hi>Ibas</hi> tells <hi>Maris,</hi> and wiſheth him to ſhew the ſame, <hi>Omnibus patribus noſtris pacem amantibus, to all their Fathers, to the whole ſociety of Neſtorians,</hi> and all that loved the peace with them, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> did now, <hi>contraria docere priori doctrinae, teach the contrarie to his former doctrine,</hi> that hee anathematized it and all that held it.

               <p n="43">43. This to be that which <hi>Ibas</hi> and other Neſtorians meant by <hi>Cyrills</hi> explanation of his Chapters, the words of <hi>Ibas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe uttered in the judgement, before <hi>Photius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> 16 yeares after the <hi>union,</hi> doe make cleare; for although <hi>Ibas</hi> had then in the maine point renounced Neſtorianiſme: yet he ſtill retained a touch or ſmack of their Neſtorian language, hee had not as yet perfectly learned to pronounce <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> nor wholy weaned himſelfe, or diſuſed his tongue from thoſe Neſtorian phraſes, which were ſo familiar in their mouthes.

               <p n="44">44. <hi>Baronius</hi> darkely ſaw, and cloſely ſignified this, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the effect of <hi>Ibas</hi> anſwere at that judgement, he ſaith<note n="c" place="margin">Bar. an. <hi>448.</hi> nu. <hi>65.</hi>

               <p n="52">52. But that which I principally aimed at, out of thoſe words of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> was, to obſerve, that <hi>Cyrils</hi> Explanation here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and meant by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> neither is, nor can be ought elſe but an abſolute condemning, and anathematizing of his twelve Chapters; for by that explanation, which <hi>Vigilius</hi> intendeth, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> ſhewed, that his ſenſe was the very ſame with that which <hi>Ibas</hi> had before, and after the <hi>union,</hi> but that ſenſe which <hi>Ibas</hi> had before, and divers yeares after the union, was, that the <hi>two Natures</hi> in Chriſt make <hi>two diſtinct Perſons,</hi> and that <hi>Cyrils</hi> twelve Chapters, in which it is conſtantly taught, that there is but one Perſon (or, as the Neſtorians ſpake, but one nature) in Chriſt, are hereticall, and to be anathematized, as being contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith; wherefore, that Explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, which <hi>Vigilius</hi> intendeth, is certainly a declaring and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that there is not one, but two diſtinct Perſons in Chriſt; and that his own twelve Chapters, for teaching but one Perſon, are all of them hereticall, and to be anathematized.</p>
               <p n="53">53. The third reaſon is taken from <hi>Vigilius</hi> his ſcope and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this whole paſſage: Suppoſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> to have meant the orthodoxall Explanation<note n="n" place="margin">Quae extat in Actis Conc.

                  <hi>Vigilius</hi> by approving that Explanation, had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Ibas,</hi> and every part thereof.

               <p n="54">54.

My concluſion now of this ſecond reaſon of <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> for defence of this Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas,</hi> is this: ſeeing the one defineth, and the other defendeth both <hi>Ibas</hi> himſelfe, and his profeſſion in this Epiſtle, in this point, and in the ſenſe of <hi>Ibas</hi> to be orthodoxall, becauſe <hi>Ibas</hi> profeſſeth therein two natures, and one perſon to bee in Chriſt; and ſeeing as wee have certainly proved, <hi>Ibas</hi> meant <hi>two ſuch natures, as make two diſtinct perſons,</hi> and one perſon, not by a naturall, and hypoſtaticall union, but onely by affection, liking and cohabitation, which is the very he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie condemned in <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> It doth hence clearly and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably enſue, not onely that this <hi>third Chapter</hi> touching the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas,</hi> doth concerne the faith, and is a <hi>queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cauſe of faith,</hi> but that <hi>Vigilius</hi> firſt, and next <hi>Baronius,</hi> and then all who by word or writing, doe defend either <hi>Vigilius</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or the Popes judgment in cauſes of faith to be <hi>infallible,</hi> that they all by defending this Epiſtle as orthodoxall; or that <hi>Ibas</hi> by it ought to bee judged a Catholike, doe thereby main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the condemned hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> to be the onely Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 23.</note> theſe diſputations about the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> the queſtion was not ſuch, <hi>ut alter ab altero aliter ſentiens, dici poſſet haereticus: that one diſſenting from another herein, might be called an heretike.</hi> So <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius;</hi> who to free <hi>Vigilius</hi> from hereſie, acquits all that deale either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra</hi> in this cauſe, neither one ſide, nor the other are heretikes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See how hereſie makes a man to dote. That this queſtion about the <hi>three Chapters</hi> is a cauſe of faith, wee have cleerly and unanſwerably confirmed; and <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe hath confeſſed; That the defenders of them, and condemners, were in a manifeſt contradiction in this cauſe, (the former, by an evident conſequent and cunningly defending; the other condemning the hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius</hi>) is moſt evident, and yet both of them in the Cardinals judgement are good Catholikes: neither the one, who with the Neſtorians <hi>deny Chriſt to be God:</hi> nor the other, <hi>who affirme him to be God,</hi> may be called heretikes. This truly is either the ſame hereſie which the Rhetorians maintained, who as <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> ſaith<note n="c" place="margin">Haereſ. <hi>43.</hi> Prateol. lib. <hi>17.</hi> Haereſ. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> praiſed all ſects and opinions, and ſaid they all went the right way; or elſe it is an hereſie peculiar to <hi>Baronius,</hi> ſuch as none before him ever dreamed of; <hi>That two contradictories in a cauſe of faith may be held, and yet neither of them be an hereſie,</hi> nor the pertinacious defenders of either of them both be heretikes. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> would be famous for a peece of new found learning, and an hereticall quirke, above all that ever went before him, ſuch as by which he hath <hi>ex condigno,</hi> merited an applauſe of all heretiks
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7680:97"/> which either have beene or ſhall ariſe hereafter. For ſeeing in this cauſe of faith two contradictories may be held without here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the like may be in every other point of faith; and ſo with <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> the Arians, Eutycheans, and all heretikes ſhall have their <hi>quietus eſt:</hi> ſay what they will in any cauſe of faith, none may call them heretikes. I commend the Cardinall for his wit. This makes all cocke ſure, it is an unexpugnable bulwarke to defend the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of Pope <hi>Vigilius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Say you, neither the defenders, nor the condemners of theſe Chapters may for that cauſe bee called heretikes? For the condemners of them, trouble not your wit, they are and ſhall be ever acknowledged for Catholikes. But for the defenders of them, who are the onely men, that the Cardinall would gratifie by this aſſertion, I may boldly ſay with the Prophet<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.22.</note>, <hi>Though thou waſh them with nitre and much ſope, yet is their iniquity marked out:</hi> All the water in <hi>Tyber</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> cannot waſh away their hereſie: for as we have before fully declared, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any one, much more of all theſe <hi>three Chapters,</hi> is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of Neſtorianiſme, and all the blaſphemies thereof, the condemning of the holy Councels of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and of all that approve them, that is, of the whole catholike Church, and of the whole Catholike Faith. All theſe muſt be hereticall, if the defenders of thoſe <hi>three Chapters</hi> be not heretikes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now againſt this aſſertion of <hi>Baronius,</hi> whereby he would acquit <hi>Vigilius</hi> and all that defend him from hereſie: I will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe another and true aſſertion, enſuing of that which wee have clearly proved; and this it is: That, <hi>one or moe, either men or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may diſſent from the Popes Cathedrall and definitive ſentence in a cauſe of faith, made knowne unto them, and yet be no heretikes.</hi> For to omit other inſtances no leſſe effectuall, this one concerning <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> doth make this moſt evident. The cauſe was a <hi>cauſe of faith,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe often profeſſeth.<note n="e" place="margin">Vid. ſup. ca. <hi>5.</hi> nu. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> The Popes defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſentence in that <hi>cauſe of faith,</hi> made for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe <hi>three Chapters,</hi> was publiſhed and made knowne to the fift generall Councell, and to the whole Church: this alſo <hi>Baronius</hi> confeſſeth<note n="f" place="margin">An. <hi>553.</hi> nu. <hi>47.</hi> vid. ſup. ca. <hi>3.</hi> nu. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note>, and yet they who contradicted the Popes <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſentence in this <hi>cauſe of faith,</hi> made knowne unto them, were not heretikes: this alſo is the confeſſion of <hi>Baronius,</hi> whoſe aſſertion as you have ſeene is, that neither the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of theſe Chapters, nor the defenders of them were heretiks. So by the Cardinalls owne aſſertions: one may contradict and oppugne the Popes knowne, Cathedral, and <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in cauſe of faith, and yet bee no heretike. But what ſpeake I of <hi>Baronius,</hi> the evidence and force of reaſon doth unreſiſtably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this. For the whole fift generall Councell contradicted, yea condemned and accurſed the Popes Cathedrall and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſentence in this cauſe of faith made knowne unto them. The whole Catholike Church ever ſince hath approved the fift
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7680:98"/> Councell, and the decree thereof, and therefore hath contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, condemned and accurſed the Popes ſentence as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had done. And none I hope will be ſo impudently hereticall, as to call not onely the fift generall and holy Councell, but the whole Catholike Church of God, heretikes: who yet muſt all be heretikes, or elſe the diſſenting from, yea the deteſting, and accurſing the Popes Cathedrall ſentence in a <hi>cauſe of faith,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make one an heretike.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I ſay more, and adde this as a further conſequent on that which hath been declared, <hi>That none can now aſſent to their Popes, or to their Cathedrall definitions</hi> and doctrines maintained by the preſent Romane Church, but <hi>co nomine, even for that very cauſe,</hi> they are convicted, condemned, and accurſed heretikes. For the manifeſting of which <hi>concluſion,</hi> I will begin with that their <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall</hi> poſition of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibility</hi> in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cauſes of faith, whereof before I have ſo often made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And to prove the preſent Romane Church to bee hereticall herein, <hi>two things</hi> are to be declared: the one that this is indeed the <hi>poſition</hi> or doctrine of their Church: the other, that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is <hi>hereticall,</hi> and for ſuch condemned by the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the former; that the aſſertion of Popes <hi>infallibility</hi> in defining cauſes of faith, is the doctrine of the preſent Romane Church, I thinke none converſant in their writings will make doubt. Give mee leave to propoſe ſome teſtimonies of their owne. <hi>The Pope</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

Now becauſe all doubts and controverſies of faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the one of theſe, it clearly followeth upon that decree, that the very laſt ſtay in all doubts of faith, is the Churches judgement; but that, upon no other, nor higher ſtay, doth, or can relie; for whatſoever you take beſides this, the truth, the waight, and validity of all muſt be tried in the Church, at her judgement it muſt ſtand or fall; yea, if you make a doubt of the Churches judgement it ſelfe, even that, as all other, muſt be ended by the judgement of the Church; it is the laſt Iudge of all.

               <p n="18">18. I have hitherto declared, and I feare too abundantly, that the aſſertion of the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> infallibilitie in cauſes of faith, is not onely a <hi>poſition,</hi> but the very <hi>fundamentall</hi> poſition of all the doctrines of the preſent Romane Church. In the next place we are to prove that this poſition is <hi>hereticall,</hi> and that for ſuch it was adjudged and condemned by the Catholike Church. In the proofe whereof I ſhall not need to ſtay long. This whole treatiſe, and even that which hath already beene declared touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth evidently confirme the ſame. For ſeeing the defending of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> hath been proved<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ca.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</note> to be hereticall, the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> made in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe Chapters, muſt of neceſſity be confeſſed to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall. Nay if you well conſider, you ſhall ſee, that this very <hi>poſition</hi> of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibilitie,</hi> is adjudged to bee hereticall. For the fift generall Councell knew this cauſe of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> to bee <hi>a cauſe of faith.</hi> They knew further that Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> decree, and Cathedrall Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had defined that thoſe <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to bee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now ſeeing they knew both theſe, and yet judicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the defence of thoſe <hi>Three Chapters</hi> to be hereticall, and for ſuch accurſed it, even in doing this, they define the <hi>Cathedrall</hi> judgement of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this <hi>cauſe of Faith,</hi> to be hereticall; and therefore moſt certainly and <hi>à fortiori</hi> define this <hi>poſition</hi> [That the Popes Cathedrall ſentence in a cauſe of faith is infallible] to bee <hi>hereticall,</hi> and for ſuch they anathematize both it, and all that defend it. And becauſe the judgement and definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the fift Councell is conſonant to all former, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all ſubſequent Councels till the <hi>Laterane</hi> Synod under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, it unavoydably hence enſueth, that the ſame <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:7680:102"/> of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibility</hi> in <hi>cauſes of faith,</hi> is by the judgement of all generall Councells untill that time, that is, by the conſtant, and uniforme conſent of the whole Catholike Church, adjudged, condemned, and accurſed for hereticall, and all who defend it for heretikes. And ſeeing we have cleerly proved the whole preſent Romane Church, and all that are members therof, to defend this <hi>poſition,</hi> yea to defend it as the maine <hi>foundation</hi> of their whole faith; the evidence of that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I propoſed<note n="g" place="margin">Sup. hoc. cap. nu. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note>, doth now manifeſtly appeare: <hi>That none can now aſſent to the Pope, or to the doctrines of the preſent Church of Rome,</hi> but he is, <hi>eo nomine, even for that very cauſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged and condemned for hereticall, and that even in the very ground and foundation of his faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. From the foundation let us proceed to the walls and roofe of their religion. Thinke you the foundation thereof is onely <hi>hereticall;</hi> and the doctrines which they build thereon <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall?</hi> Nothing leſſe; They are both ſutable, both hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.

And yet by that <hi>fundamentall poſition,</hi> they are bound (and now doe <hi>implicitè</hi>) beleeve whatſoever any Pope either by word or writing, either hath already, or ſhall at any time hereafter define to be a doctrine of faith. Becauſe I will not ſtay on particulars, if any pleaſe ſeriouſly to conſider this matter, hee ſhall perceive (that which now I intend to prove) ſuch venome of <hi>infidelity</hi> to lye in that one <hi>fundamentall poſition</hi> of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibility,</hi> that by reaſon of holding it, they neither doe nor can beleeve or hold with <hi>certaintie of faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:7680:103"/> any one point or doctrine, which they profeſſe to beleeve, and hold upon that <hi>Foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. For the clearing of which point (being very materiall) it is to be obſerved, that unto certainty of faith, two things are of neceſſity required; The one <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> on the part of thing beleeved, which muſt be ſo true and certaine in it ſelfe, that it cannot poſſibly bee or have beene otherwiſe then it is beleeved to be, to have beene, or to be hereafter. And therefore none can truly beleeve any untruth, for nothing which is untrue, is or can be the object of faith. The other thing is required, <hi>ex parte ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti,</hi> on the part of him who beleeveth. Now faith being onely of ſuch things as are inevident, that is, which neither by ſenſe can be perceived, nor by naturall reaſon collected or found out; but which are onely by the teſtimonie of ſuch as firſt knew them, made knowne unto us, and none doth or can know that which is ſupernaturall, unleſſe God himſelfe reveale the ſame unto him, it hence followeth that whatſoever is by any beleeved, the ſame is revealed and teſtified to him by God himſelfe, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: and further, that it is certainly knowne unto him who beleeveth, that it is God himſelfe, who doth reveale and teſtifie that thing unto him. For otherwiſe though the doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, be in it ſelfe never ſo certaine and divine, yet unto thee, or me, it cannot be certaine, nor held by certainty of faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe firſt we be ſure and infallibly certaine, that he who teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it unto us is himſelfe infallible, that is, that he is God. Let us for perſpicuity, call the former of theſe two, <hi>materiale fidei,</hi> the materiall in faith or the thing beleeved: and the later, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male fidei,</hi> that which is formall in faith, ſeeing as the former is the thing beleeved, ſo the later containes the reaſon, the ground or foundation upon which, and for which it is beleeved.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Conſider now firſt the <hi>materials</hi> in their <hi>faith.</hi> In them there is a great difference; for ſome of them are in themſelves credible, as being divine truths, and true objects of faith. Such are all thoſe Catholike truths common to us and them, as that there is a <hi>Trinity, that Chriſt was borne of a Virgin, dyed, roſe againe,</hi> and the like. Others are in themſelves untrue, ſuch as cannot be the object of faith: Of this ſort are all thoſe doctrines wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they diſſent from us, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, reall and proper ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, worſhipping of Images, Purgatory, Iuſtification</hi> by the merit or dignity of our works, and the like, which may rightly bee called popiſh doctrines. The later ſort of theſe they neither <hi>doe nor can beleeve.</hi> The former they <hi>might,</hi> but they <hi>doe not beleeve.</hi> The reaſon whereof will appeare by conſidering that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall or the fundamentall ground of their faith: where it is firſt to be obſerved, that a man may hold many, yea all the doctrines profeſſed by the preſent Church, except that one of the Popes <hi>Cathedrall infallibility,</hi> and yet bee no <hi>Papiſt</hi> or member of their preſent Church. For although the things profeſſed, or the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:7680:103"/> be the ſelfe ſame, yet the formalitie or diverſe reaſon of holding them, cauſeth a maine difference in the parties that hold them. And for our preſent purpoſe it may ſuffice to note three divers wayes, whereby their doctrines are or may be held.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The firſt is, of them, who build all thoſe doctrines upon the <hi>Scripture</hi> as the <hi>Foundation</hi> thereof: upon that ground, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely many Catholike truths, which they moſt firmly beleeve, the Church inducing, the Scriptures outwardly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the holy Spirit inwardly ſealing, the ſame unto them: but together with thoſe truths hold ſome errors alſo of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church (take for example <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi>) which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the inducement of that preſent Church wherein they live, they thinke to be taught in the Scriptures, and therefore hold and profeſſe them, and thinke they beleeve them, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are neither in truth taught in the Scriptures, nor ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Gods Spirit unto their hearts, therefore they hold not theſe; nor in truth can they hold them with that firmneſſe and certainty of faith, as they doe the former truths, but they have a faintnes and feare in their aſſent unto theſe, and ſo a readines and willing preparation of heart, to diſclaime theſe, and to hold or profeſſe the contrary, if ever it may be fully cleared &amp; manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Scriptures unto them. Of this ſort we doubt not but many thouſands of our fathers were; who living in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; thicke miſts of their Antichriſtian ſuperſtition, upon the Scriptures &amp; word of God which they held for the foundation of their ſaith, builded indeed much gold &amp; precious ſtones, but with a mixture of much hay, ſtubble &amp; droſſe, thinking (but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry erroneouſly) the later as well as the former to be contained in that <hi>foundation.</hi> The ſtate of all theſe is very like to S. <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and thoſe other Africane Biſhops, which were ſo earneſt for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſuppoſing it to be taught in the Scriptures, &amp; though the <hi>foundation</hi> of it, &amp; of thoſe catholike truths that Chriſt was God, or the like, was one and the ſame unto them, yet they held not both with like firmnes &amp; certainty of faith. The doctrine of Chriſts deity &amp; manhood they ſo beleeved, that they would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with any that denied this, nay they would rather die then deny it. But <hi>Rebaptization</hi> they ſo held, as not thinking their oppoſites to be heretikes, nor refuſing<note n="p" place="margin">Haecre ſcripſimus, nemini praeſcriben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, aut praejudican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes quo minus unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque quod puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit faciat, habent liberam arbitrij ſui facultate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes touching this error in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of whom being ſo very learned, he ſaith, <hi>Propterea non vidit aliquid ut per eum aliud eminentius videretur; He therefore ſaw not this one truth touching Rebaptization, that others might ſee in him a more eminent and excellent truth.</hi> And what truth is that? In him we may ſee the truth of Humilitie, the truth of modeſtie, the truth of Charitie and ardent love to the peace, and unitie of the Church: but the moſt excellent truth that I can ſee, or as I thinke, can be ſeene in <hi>erring Cyprian</hi> is this, <hi>that one may be a true Catholike, a Catholike Biſhop, a pillar of Gods Church, yea even a Saint and glorious Martyr, and yet hold an error in faith,</hi> as did that holy Catholike Biſhop, and bleſſed Martyr Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi> To him then and the other Africane Biſhops, who in like ſort erred as he did; may fitly be compared the ſtate of thoſe ſervants of God, who in the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and invincible ignorance of thoſe times of Antichriſt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many golden truths, which they moſt firmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, upon that ſolid <hi>foundation</hi> of the Scriptures, held either <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or the like errors, thinking them (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did, of <hi>Rebaptization</hi>) to be taught in that <hi>foundation</hi> alſo. They erred in ſome doctrines of faith, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe errors, they may be Catholikes, and bleſſed as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, becauſe they both firmely beleeved many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike truths, and their error was without pertinacie as <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was. For none, who truly beleeves the Scripture, and holds it for the <hi>foundation</hi> of his faith, can with pertinacie hold any doctrine repugnant to the Scripture, ſeeing in his very beleeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, and holding it as the <hi>foundation,</hi> he doth in truth, though <hi>implicitiè,</hi> and <hi>in radice,</hi> as I may ſay, beleeve the flat contrarie to that error, which <hi>explicitè</hi> he profeſſeth. And becauſe he doth <hi>implicitè</hi> beleeve the contrarie thereof, he hath, (even all the time while he ſo erreth) a readineſſe and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hart to profeſſe the contrarie whenſoever out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſhall bee deduced and manifeſted unto him.</p>
               <p n="23">23. A ſecond way of holding thoſe doctrines, is of them, who together with the truths, hold the errours alſo of their Church, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatorie,</hi> or the like, thinking them to bee taught in Scriptures, as did the former, but adding obſtinacie, or pertinacie to their holding of them, which the former did not. And their pertinacie is apparant hereby, if either they will not yeeld to the truth, being manifeſted out of the Scriptures unto them, or if before ſuch manifeſtation, they be ſo addicted and wedded to their owne wills, and conceits,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7680:104"/> that they reſolve either not to heare, or if they doe heare, not to yeeld to the evidence of reaſon, when they are convinced by it. For it is certaine, that one may bee truly pertinacious not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after conviction, and manifeſtation of the truth, but even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it alſo, if he have a reſolution not to yeeld to the authority, and weight of convincing reaſons. Of this ſort were all thoſe who ever ſince their ſecond <hi>Nicen</hi> Synod (about which time, the Romane Church made their firſt publike defection from the true and ancient faith) tooke part with that faction in the Church, which maintained the <hi>adoration</hi> of Images, and after that, <hi>Depoſing</hi> of Princes, then <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and other like hereſies, as they crept by degrees into the Church, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ages. From that time untill <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, the Church was like a confuſed lumpe, wherein both gold and droſſe were mingled together: or like a great Citie infected with the plague. All as well the ſicke as ſound, lived together within the walls, and bounds of that Citie, but all were not infected; and of thoſe that were, not all alike infected, with thoſe hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſeaſes which then raigned, &amp; more, and more prevaled in the Church. Some openly, and conſtantly withſtood the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and hereſies of their time, and being worthy Martyrs, ſealed with their blood that truth which they profeſſed. Others diſſented from the ſame errors, but durſt not with courage, and ſortitude oppoſe themſelves; ſuch as would ſay to their friends in private: Thus<note n="ſ" place="margin">Paralip. ad Abb.

Onely that violent, and ſtrong faction, which pertinaciouſly adhered to the hereticall doctrines, which then ſprung up, (the head of which faction was the Pope) and who preferred their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, before the truth, out of the Scriptures manifeſted unto them, and by ſome Councels, alſo decreed, as namely by that at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantinus Iconomachus,</hi> and that at <hi>Frankford,</hi> theſe I ſay who wilfully and maliciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, yea perſecuted the truth and ſuch as ſtood in defence of it, are thoſe, who are ranked in this ſecond order, who though they are not in proprietie of ſpeech to bee called Papiſts, yet becauſe the errors which they held are the ſame, which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church now maintaineth, they are truly and properly to be tearmed <hi>Popiſh Heretickes.</hi>

               <p n="24">24. The third way of holding their doctrines, beganne with their <hi>Lateran</hi> decree, under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, at which time they held the ſame doctrines which they did before, but they held the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now upon another <hi>Foundation.</hi> For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they caſt away the old

For although the Pope long before that time, had made no ſmall progreſſe in Antichriſtianiſme, firſt in uſurping an univerſall authority over all Biſhops, next in upholding their impious doctrines of <hi>Adoration</hi> of Images, and the like, and after that in exalting himſelfe above all Kings and Emperors, giving and taking away their Crownes at his pleaſure; yet the height of the Antichriſtian myſterie conſiſted in none of theſe, nor did he ever attaine unto it, till by vertue of that Laterane decree he had juſtled out Chriſt and his word, and laid himſelfe and his owne word in the ſtead thereof, for the Rocke &amp; <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Catholike faith.

Neither is this true onely in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points, but even in this very <hi>foundation</hi> it ſelfe: for the fift Councell, which decreed the Cathedrall and <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the cauſe of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> to be hereticall, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the decrees of Pope <hi>Gregory, Agatho,</hi> and the reſt, unto <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth.

This, whoſoever doe, whether they bee moe, or fewer then thoſe from whom they ſeparate themſelves, they are truly and properly to bee termed Schiſmatikes, and factious. For it is neither multitude, nor paucitie, nor the holding with, or againſt any viſible head, or governour whatſoever, nor the bare act of ſeparating ones ſelfe from others; but only the cauſe, for which the ſeparation is made, which maketh a Schiſme or faction, and truly denounceth one to be factious, or a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike.

               </p>
               <p n="37">37. Apply now this to <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the fift generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and the caſe will be cleare. The onely cauſe of ſeparation on the Councels part, was, for that <hi>Vigilius</hi> with all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7680:111"/> were Heretikes, convicted, condemned; and accurſed for ſuch, by that, true ſentence, and judgement of the fift gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell, which was conſonant both to Scriptures, Fathers, and the foure former generall Councels, and approved by all ſucceeding generall Councels, Popes, and Biſhops, that is, by the judgement of the whole Catholike Church, for more then fifteene hundreth yeares together. A cauſe not onely moſt juſt, but commanded by the holy Apoſtle<note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.</note>, <hi>Shun him that is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, after once or twice admonition,</hi> much more after publike conviction and condemnation, by the upright judgement of the whole Catholike Church. On the other ſide, <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his Faction ſeparated themſelves from the Councell, and all that tooke part with it, for this onely reaſon, becauſe they were Catholikes; becauſe they embraced and conſtantly defended the Catholike faith; becauſe he wold not cooperate (as <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſpeaketh) with them, to maintaine the true Catholike faith, and ſo on their part, there was that which eſſentially made them Schiſmatickes. <hi>Baronius</hi> in ſaying that thoſe who then diſſented from <hi>Vigilius,</hi> were Schiſmatickes, ſpeakes ſutably to all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aſſertions; For in ſaying this, he in effect ſaith, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to avoid a Schiſme, ſhould have turned Heretickes, ſhould have embraced Neſtorianiſme, and ſo have renounced and condemned the whole Catholike faith, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> then did. Had they ſo done, they ſhould have been no Schiſmatikes with <hi>Baronius:</hi> But now for not condemning the Catholike faith with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> they muſt all be condemned by the Cardinall, for Schiſmatickes.</p>
               <p n="38">38. For the very ſame reaſon, the whole preſent Romane Church are Schiſmatickes at this day; and not the Reformed Churches from whom they ſeparate themſelves. For the cauſe of ſeparation on their part, is the ſame for which <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his ſchiſmaticall faction ſeparated themſelves from the fift Councell, and the Catholikes of thoſe times who all tooke part with it, even becauſe wee refuſe to embrace the Popes <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall</hi> ſentence in cauſes of faith, as the fift Councell refuſed that of <hi>Vigilius.</hi> The cauſe on our part is the ſame which the fift Councell then had, for that they defend the Popes hereticall <hi>conſtitution:</hi> nay not onely that of <hi>Vigilius</hi> (which yet were cauſe enough) but many other like unto that, and eſpecially that one of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth with his Laterane Councell, wherby <hi>Supremacie</hi> and with it <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> of judgement is given unto the Pope in all his decrees of faith: In which one <hi>Cathedrall</hi> decree (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereticall by the fift Councell, and conſtant judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of precedent and ſubſequent Councells, as before we have declared) not onely innumerable hereſies ſuch as none yet doth dreame of, are included, but by the venom and poyſon of that one fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall hereſie, not only all the other doctrines are corrupted, but the very <hi>foundation</hi> of faith is utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7680:111"/> Let them boaſt of multitudes, and univerſalitie never ſo much, (which at this day is but a vaine brag) ſay they were far more, even foure hundreth to one <hi>Luther,</hi> or the whole kingdome of <hi>Babilon</hi> to the two witneſſes of God; yet ſeeing it is the cauſe which makes a ſchiſmaticke; &amp; the cauſe of ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on their part is moſt unjuſt, but on ours moſt warrantable &amp; holy, for that they will not cooperate with us, in upholding the ancient and Catholike faith, that eſpecially of the fift Councell, condemning and accurſing the Cathedrall ſentence of Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> as hereticall, &amp; all that defend it, as Heretickes, it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth, that they are the only, &amp; eſſentially ſchiſmatickes, at this time, and in this great rent of the Church,</p>

But it is one thing to profeſſe the ſcriptures, or thoſe three Councells, and ſay that he beleeves them, which many heretikes may doe; and another thing to beleeve them indeed, which none can doe and be an heretike, for whoſoever truly beleeveth the ſcriptures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly with pertinacy hold any doctrine repugnant to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but ſuch a man upon evident declaration that this is taught in them (though before he held the contrary) preſently ſubmits his wit and will to the truth which out of them is manifeſted unto him.

               <p n="15">15. Whence two things are evidently conſequent, the former, that all heretikes are lyars in their profeſſion: not onely becauſe they profeſſe that doctrine which is untrue, and hereticall, but becauſe in words they profeſſe to beleeve and hold that doctrine which they doe not, but hold, and that for a point of their faith, the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: All of them will and doe profeſſe that they beleeve the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the doctrines therein contained: and yet every one of them lye herein, for they beleeve one, if not moe doctrines contrary to the ſcriptures. The <hi>Neſtorians</hi> profeſſed to hold the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith, and ſo they profeſſed two natures and but one perſon to bee in Chriſt, for that in the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith is certainly decreed: but they lyed in making this profeſſion, for they beleeved not one perſon, but pertinaciouſly held two perſons to be in Chriſt. The <hi>Eutycheans</hi> in profeſſing the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Councell, profeſſed in effect two natures to abide in Chriſt after the union, for this was certainly the faith of that holy Councell, but they lyed in this profeſſion, for they held that after the union two natures did not abide in Chriſt, but one onely. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and members thereof profeſſe to hold the faith of the fift generall Councell, and ſo profeſſe <hi>implicitè</hi> the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> ſentence in a cauſe of faith to be <hi>fallible</hi> and hereticall: but they lye in making this profeſſion, for they beleeve not the Popes ſentence in ſuch cauſes to be fallible, but with the <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> Councels, they hold it to be <hi>infallible.</hi> It is the practice of all heretikes to make ſuch faire, though lying profeſſions. For ſhould they ſay in plaine termes, (that which is truth indeed) wee beleeve not the ſcriptures, nor the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of <hi>Nice, Epheſus,</hi> or <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> every man would ſpit at them, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7680:116"/> deteſt them, <hi>cane pejus &amp; angue,</hi> nor could they ever deceive any, or gaine one proſelyte. But when they commend their faith (that is, their hereſie) to be the ſame doctrine with the ſcriptures, which the Councells of <hi>Nice, Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> taught, by theſe faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and this lying profeſſion, they inſinuate themſelves into the hearts of the ſimple, deceiving hereby both themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The other conſequent is this, That the profeſſion of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes is contradictory to it ſelfe. For they profeſſe to hold the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo to condemne every hereſie, and yet withal they profeſſe one private doctrine repugnant to ſcripture, and which is an hereſie. The like may be ſaid of the Councells. The <hi>Neſtorians</hi> by profeſsing to hold the faith decreed at <hi>Nice,</hi> profeſſe Chriſt to bee but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet withall by holding <hi>Neſtorianiſme,</hi> they profeſſe Chriſt to be two perſons. The <hi>Eutycheans</hi> by profeſsing to hold the Councell of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> profeſſe two natures to remaine in Chriſt after the union; which in that Councell is certainly decreed, and yet by profeſsing the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> they profeſſe the quite contradictory, that one nature onely remaines after the union. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, by profeſſing the faith of the fift Councell, profeſſe the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> ſentence in a cauſe of faith to be <hi>fallible,</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> to have beene <hi>hereticall;</hi> and yet they profeſſe the direct contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the Councell of <hi>Laterane</hi> hath defined, that the Popes ſentence in ſuch cauſes is <hi>infallible,</hi> and neither hath beene nor can be <hi>hereticall.</hi> So repugnant to it ſelfe, and incoherent is the profeſſion of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that it ſighteth both with the truth, and with it owne ſelfe alſo. The very ſame is to be ſeene in <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> For in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to defend the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> and in decreeing that all ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, he profeſſeth all the blaſphemies of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and decreeth that all ſhall maintaine them, and profeſſing to hold the faith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and decreeing that all ſhall hold it, hee profeſſeth that <hi>Neſtorianiſme</hi> is hereſie, and decreeth that all ſhall condemne it for hereſie: and ſo decreeing both theſe, he decreeth that all men in the world ſhall beleeve two contradictories, and beleeve them as Catholike Truths. Such a worthy <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> decree is this of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> for defending whereof <hi>Baronius</hi> doth more then toyle himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. You will againe demand: Seeing <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth ſo earneſtly and plainely profeſſe both theſe, why ſhall not his expreſſe profeſſion to hold the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> make him or ſhew him to bee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, rather then his other expreſſe profeſſion, to defend the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> make or ſhew him to bee an hereticke? Why rather ſhall his <hi>hereticall,</hi> then his <hi>orthodoxall</hi> profeſſion give denomination unto him? I alſo demand of you, Seeing every hereticke in expreſſe words profeſſeth to beleeve the whole Scripture, which is in effect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of every hereſie, why ſhall not this <hi>orthodoxall</hi> profeſſion make or ſhew him to be a Catholike, rather then his expreſſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome one doctrine contrarie to Scripture (ſay for example ſake, of <hi>Arianiſme</hi>) make or ſhew him to bee an <hi>Arian</hi> hereticke? The
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7680:116"/> reaſon of both is one and the ſame. Did an <hi>Arian</hi> ſo profeſſe to hold the Scriptures, that hee were reſolved to forſake his <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> and confeſſe Chriſt to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon manifeſtation that the Scriptures taught this, certainely his profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> with ſuch a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold the Scriptures, could not make him an hereticke, no more then <hi>Cyprians</hi> profeſſion of Rebaptization, or <hi>Irenees</hi> of the millenarie hereſie, did make them heretikes: Erre hee ſhould, as they did, but being not pertinacious in error, hereticke hee could not be, as they were not. But it falls out otherwiſe with all heretickes. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to hold the Scripture, yet ſo that they reſolve not to forſake that private doctrine which they have choſen to maintaine: That they will hold, and they will have that to be the doctrine of the Scripture, notwithſtanding all manifeſtation to the contrarie, even of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves. They reſolve of this, that whoſoever, Biſhops, Councells, or Church, teach the contrarie to that, or ſay &amp; judge that the Scripture ſo teacheth, they all erre or miſtake the meaning of the Scriptures. Thus did not <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nor <hi>Irenee.</hi> And this wilfull and pertinacious reſolution it is, which evidently ſheweth that in truth they beleeve not the Scriptures, but beleeve their own fancies, though they ſay a thouſand times, that they beleeve and embrace whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Scriptures teach, for did they beleeve any doctrine, ſay <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, eo nomine,</hi> becauſe the Scripture teacheth it, they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently beleeve the contrarie thereunto, when it were manifeſted unto them (as is was to the <hi>Arians,</hi> by the <hi>Nicen</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell) that the Scripture taught the contrarie to their error. Seeing this they will not doe, It is certaine that they hold their private opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>eo nomine</hi> becauſe they will hold it; and they hold it to bee the doctrine of ſcripture, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo, but becauſe they will have it to bee ſo, ſay what any will or can to the contrarie. So their owne will, and not Scripture, is the reaſon why they beleeve it, nay why they hold it with ſuch a ſtiffe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for beleife it is not, it cannot be. This pertinacie to have beene in the <hi>Neſtorians, Eutycheans</hi> and the reſt, is evident. Had they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as they profeſſed, the faith decreed at <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on manifeſtation of their errors out of thoſe Councels, they would have renounced their hereſies: but ſeeing the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> perſiſted to hold two perſons in Chriſt, notwithſtanding, that the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> manifeſted unto them that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel held but one perſon, and ſeeing the <hi>Eutycheans</hi> perſiſted to hold but one nature after the union, notwithſtanding that the whole Councell at <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> manifeſted unto them, that the holy <hi>Epheſine</hi> Synod held two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to abide in him after the union, they did hereby make it evident unto all, that they ſo profeſſed to hold thoſe Councels, as that they reſolved not to forſake their <hi>Neſtorian</hi> and <hi>Eutichean</hi> hereſies for any manifeſtation of the truth, or conviction of their error out of thoſe Councels, and their profeſſion of them was in effect as if they had ſaid, we hold thoſe Councels, and will have them to teach what wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, whatſoever any manor Councell ſaith, or can ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. The like muſt be ſaid of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this cauſe: Had he ſo profeſſed to hold the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as that upon manifeſtion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7680:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> were condemned by it, he would have forſaken the defence of them, then certainely his defending of theſe 3. <hi>Chapters</hi> had not bin pertinacious, nor ſhould have made him an hereticke, but his profeſſion to hold the faith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> notwithſtanding his error about the 3. <hi>Chapters,</hi> ſhould have made him a catholike. But ſeeing <hi>Vig.</hi> perſiſted to defend the 3. <hi>Chapt.</hi> though it was made evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t unto him by the Synodall judgement of the fift Councell, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of ſaith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned them all, he by this perſiſting in hereſie did demonſtrate to all, that he profeſſed to hold the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> no otherwiſe then with a pertinacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution not to forſake the defence of thoſe <hi>Three hereticall Chapters,</hi> although the whole Church of God ſhould manifeſt unto him, that the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned the ſame: and for this cauſe his defending of thoſe <hi>three Chapters,</hi> with this pertinacie and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſolution declareth him to bee indeed an hereticke, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his profeſſion to hold the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and faith thereof, whereby all thoſe Chapters are condemned, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion being joyned with the former pertinacie, could not now either make or declare him to be a Catholike.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The very ſame muſt bee ſaid of the preſent <hi>Romane</hi> Church and members thereof. Did they in ſuch ſort profeſſe to hold the fift Councel, and faith thereof, as that upon manifeſtation that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell beleeved, taught and decreed that the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> ſentence in a cauſe of faith is <hi>fallible,</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> hath beene hereticall, they would condemne that their <hi>fundamentall</hi> hereſie of the Popes <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall infallibilitie</hi> decreed in their <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> aſſemblies, then ſhould they much rather, for their profeſſion of the fift Councell and faith thereof, bee <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> then for profeſſing (together with this) the Popes <hi>Cathedrall infallibilitie,</hi> bee hereticall. But ſeeing they know by the very Acts and judiciall ſentence of that fift Councell, by which the <hi>Cathedrall Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is condemned and accurſed for hereticall in this cauſe of faith, touching the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> that the fift Councell beleeved this, and decreed, under the cenſure of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould beleeve it, and that all who beleeve the contrary, are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes: ſeeing, I ſay, notwithſtanding this manifeſtation of the faith of that Councell, they perſiſt to defend the Popes <hi>Cathedrall infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in thoſe cauſes, yea, defend it as the very foundation of their faith; this makes it evident to all, that they do no otherwiſe profeſſe to hold this fift Councell, or the other, whether precedent, or following, (for they all are conſonant to this) but with this pertinacious reſolution, not to forſake that their <hi>fundamentall</hi> hereſie; and therefore their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe profeſſion of this fift, and other generall Councels, yea, of the Scriptures themſelves, cannot be ſo effectuall to make them Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, as the profeſſion of the Popes <hi>infallibility,</hi> which is joyned with this pertinacy, is to make and demonſtrate them to be heretikes.</p>
               <p n="19">19. There is yet a further point to be obſerved touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy of <hi>Vigilius:</hi> For one may be, and often is pertinacious in his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, not onely after, but even before conviction, or manifeſtation of

                  </note>, and many others doe truly teach. See now, I pray you, how farre <hi>Vigilius</hi> was from this care of ſeeking, and preparation to embrace the truth. He by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authoritie decreed<note n="r" place="margin">Conſt. Vigil. apud Bar. an. <hi>553.</hi> nu. <hi>208.</hi>
                  </note> that none ſhould either write, or ſpeake, or teach ought contrary to his <hi>Conſtitution;</hi> or if they did, that his decree ſhould ſtand for a condemnation and refutation of whatſoever they ſhould either write or ſpeake. Here was a tricke of <hi>Papall,</hi> that is, of the moſt ſupreme pertinacy that can bee deviſed: He takes order before hand, that none ſhall ever, I ſay, not convict him, but, ſo much as manifeſt the truth unto him, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth, or write a ſyllable for the manifeſtation thereof: and ſo, being not prepared to bee corrected, no nor informed neither, hee was pertinacious, and is juſtly to bee ſo accounted before ever either Biſhop, or Councell manifeſted the truth unto him. Even as he is farre more wilfully and obſtinately delighted in darkneſſe, who dammes up all the windowes, chinkes, and paſſages, whereby any light might enter into the houſe, wherein hee is, than hee, who lyeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, and is willing to be awaked, when the light ſhineth about him: So was it with Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> at this time; his tying of al mens tongues, and hands, that they ſhould not manifeſt by word, or writing, the truth unto him; his damming up of the light, that never any glimpſe of the truth might ſhine unto him, argues a mind moſt damnably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious in errour, and ſo far from being prepared and ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, that it is obdurate againſt the ſame, and will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it ſo much as to come neere unto him.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The very like pertinacy is at this day in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, and all the members thereof: for having once ſet downe this tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent principle, the <hi>foundation</hi> of all which they beleeve; that the Popes judgement, in cauſes of faith, is <hi>infallible,</hi> they doe by this exclude and utterly ſhut out all manifeſtation of the truth, that can poſſibly bee made unto them: Oppoſe whatſoever you will againſt their errour, Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, reaſon and ſenſe it ſelfe, it is all refuted before it be propoſed, ſeeing the Pope, who is <hi>infallible,</hi> ſaith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which you would prove, you, in diſputing from thoſe places, doe either miſ-cite them, or miſ-interpret the Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councels, or your reaſon from them is ſophiſticall, and your ſenſe of ſight, of touching, of taſting, is deceived, ſome one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or other there is in your oppoſition; but an errour in that which they hold, there is, nay, there can be none, becauſe the Pope teacheth that, and the Pope, in his teaching is <hi>infallible.</hi> Here is a charme, which cauſeth one to heare with a deafe eare, whatſoever is oppoſed: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry head of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> if you come againſt it, it ſtunnes you at the firſt, and turnes both your reaſon, your ſenſe, and your ſelfe alſo, into a very ſtone. By holding this one <hi>fundamentall</hi> poſition, they are pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all their errours, and that in the higheſt degree of pertinacy,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7680:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> which the wit of man can deviſe; yea, and pertinacious before all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and that alſo though the truth ſhould never by any meanes be manifeſted unto them: For by ſetting this downe, they are ſo far from being prepared to embrace the truth, though it ſhould be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto them, that hereby they have made a <hi>fundamentall</hi> law for themſelves, that they never will be convicted, nor ever have the truth manifeſted unto them. The onely meanes in likelihood to perſwade them, that the doctrines which they maintaine, are hereſies, were firſt to perſwade the Pope, who hath decreed them to bee <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> to make a contrary decree, that they are <hi>hereticall.</hi> Now although this may be morally judged, to be a matter of impoſſibilitie; yet, if his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe could be induced hereunto, and would ſo farre ſtoope to Gods truth, as to make ſuch a decree; even this alſo could not perſwade them, ſo long as they hold that <hi>foundation.</hi> They would ſay, either the Pope were not the true Pope, or that he defined it not as Pope, and <hi>ex Cathedra;</hi> or that, by conſenting to ſuch an hereticall decree, hee cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to be Pope, or the like; ſome one or other evaſion they would have ſtill: but, grant the Popes ſentence to be <hi>fallible,</hi> or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, whoſe <hi>infallibility</hi> they hold as a doctrine of faith, yea, as the <hi>foundation</hi> of their faith, they would not. Such, and ſo unconquerable pertinacy is annexed, and that eſſentially, to that one <hi>Poſition,</hi> that ſo long as one holds it, (and whenſoever he ceaſeth to hold it, hee ceaſeth to be a member of their Church,) there is no poſſible meanes in the world to convict him, or convert him to the truth.</p>
               <p n="21">21. You doe now clearely ſee, how feeble, and inconſequent that Collection is, which <hi>Baronius</hi> here uſeth in excuſe of Pope <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> for that he often profeſſeth to defend the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the faith therein explaned: Hee did but herein that which is the uſuall cuſtome of all other heretikes, both ancient and moderne: Quit him for this cauſe, and quit them all; condemne them, and then, this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can no way excuſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereſie. They all with him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, with great oſtentation to hold the doctrines of the Scriptures, of Fathers, of generall Councels, but becauſe their profeſſion is not onely lying, and contradictorie to it ſelfe, but alwayes ſuch, as that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a wilfull and pertinacious reſolution, not to forſake that hereſie which themſelves embrace, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> had, not to forſake his defence of the <hi>Three Chapters:</hi> Hence it is that their verbal profeſſion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Fathers, and Councels, cannot make any of them, nor <hi>Vigilius</hi> among them, to be eſteemed <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> or Catholike: but the reall and cordiall profeſſion of any one doctrine, which they, with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy hold againſt the Scriptures, or holy generall Councels, as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> did this of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> doth truly demonſtrate them all, and <hi>Vigilius</hi> among them, to be heretikes.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Were one diſpoſed to make ſport with the Cardinall, himſelfe here offereth a large field, wherein one may exſpaciate; and ſeeing he uſeth not others as Kings, hee might expect, <hi>lege talionis,</hi> not to bee uſed himſelfe as a Cardinall: But becauſe wee ſhall in another place more fitly convince the Cardinall, both for his reviling the Emperor, and raling at his Edict, as penned by heretikes, for this time I will but by the way obſerve two or three points touching this paſſage. The firſt, that <hi>Facundus</hi> by defending the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> by fortifying his defence, doe unavoydably pull upon themſelves the juſt cenſure of <hi>Anathema,</hi> denounced by the holy Councell againſt the defenders of thoſe Chapters, and thoſe who are abetters of them: So, the more <hi>Baronius</hi> doth labour to fortifie the ſentence of <hi>Facundus,</hi> the more he entangles himſelfe in that curſe of the generall Councel. The ſecond, that both <hi>Facundus</hi> &amp; <hi>Baronius</hi> do quite miſtake the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in carping at the Emperour, as if by his Edict, or in condemning thoſe <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> he had taught or publiſhed ſome new doctrine of faith; he did not: He taught and commanded all others to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that true, ancient, and Apoſtolicall faith, which was decreed and explaned at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as both the whole fift Councell witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, which ſheweth, that all thoſe Chapters were <hi>implicitè,</hi> but yet truly, and indeed condemned in the definition of faith made at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon;</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:7680:120"/> and Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> alſo teſtifieth the ſame, ſaying of this fift Councell, that it was <hi>in omnibus ſequax, in every point a follower of the Councell at Chalcedon.</hi> This the religious Emperour wiſely diſcerning, did by his imperiall edict, and authoritie (as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had done before him) ratifie that old and Catholike faith, which the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> by defending thoſe Chapters craftily undermined at that time. The third &amp; ſpeciall point which I obſerve, is that which <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> noteth, as the cauſe why Pope <hi>Vigil.</hi> was ſo eager againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his edict. And what thinke you was it? Forſooth becauſe, <hi>Iuſtinian primus</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 237.</note>

But for Princes to preſume to teach the Pope, or make any lawes concerning the faith, before they conſult with the Romane <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> or make him acquainted therewith, thats<note n="n" place="margin">Vel ſi rectum fuiſſet, recte non fieret, quia nulli Regum hinc ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid agere, ſed ſolis eſt ſacerdoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus datum.

So then, is was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther zeale, not pietie, nor love to the truth, but meere ſtomacke and pride in <hi>Vigilius</hi> to oppoſe himſelfe to the Emperours edict, and make an inſurrection againſt him. A ſory reaſon God wot for any wiſe man in the world, much more for the Pope, to contradict the truth and oppugne the Catholike faith. Now if <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> for doing this which was an act of prudence and pietie, tending wholy to the good and peace of the Church, if hee could not eſcape ſo undutifull uſage at the Pope, &amp; his orators in thoſe better times, religious Kings may not thinke it ſtrange, to finde the like or far worſe entertainment at the Popes of theſe dayes and their inſtruments, men ſo exact and eloquent in reviling, that in all ſuch baſe and uncivill uſage they goe as farre beyond <hi>Facundus, Tertullus,</hi> and them of former ages, as droſſe or the moſt abject mettle is inferiour to refined gold. This is the firſt Period, and firſt judgement of <hi>Vigilius</hi> touching this cauſe of the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> in defence of which, and oppugning of the Emperours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, hee continued more then a yeare after the publiſhing of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, even all that time while hee remained at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was abſent from the Emperour.</p>

Here is now the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of the Popes turnings and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and often changing in this cauſe of faith: Concerning which this is eſpecially to bee remembred, that whereas all the three former judgements of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> the firſt, when he defended thoſe three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being in <hi>Italie,</hi> the ſecond, when he condemned them upon his comming to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the third, when he againe defended them at the time of the Councell, and after, have all of them certaine and undeniable proofes out of antiquitie, ſuch as the teſtimonies of <hi>Facundus, Victor, Liberatus,</hi> the Popes owne letters and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the witneſſe of the Emperor, and the whole fift Councell; onely this laſt period, and this laſt change, when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the fift Councell, and condemned the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> This I ſay, which is the onely judgement whereby <hi>Vigilius</hi> is excuſed from hereſie, is utterly deſtitute of all ancient witneſſes, not any one that I can finde makes mention of this change, or of ought that can any way enforce the ſame, and therefore this may and muſt be called the <hi>Baronian</hi> change or Period, he being the firſt man, that I can learne of, who ever mentioned or dreamed of this change. And although this alone were ſufficient to oppoſe to all that the Cardinall or any other can hence collect in excuſe of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> reaſon and equitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us to bee too credulous upon the Cardinals bare word, (which even in this one cauſe touching the Three Chapters, and this fift Councell, beſides many the like, demonſtratively to be proved untrue and falſe, I ſpeake it confidently and within compaſſe, in ſix hundreth ſayings at the leaſt) yet that they may not ſay wee decline the force of this ſo pregnant an exception, we will for a little while admit and ſuppoſe it to bee true, and try, whether by this being yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them, there can accrew any advantage to their cauſe, or any help to excuſe either <hi>Vigilius</hi> himſelfe, or his <hi>Conſtitution</hi> ſet forth in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> from being hereticall.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Say you <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his laſt decree confirmed the fift Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and approved the Catholike faith?

Then did hee certainely decree that all writings defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> doe defend hereſie: and that all perſons who defend thoſe Chapters, for ſo long time as they defend them, after the judgement of that Councell, are convicted and condemned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.

So far is this laſt and <hi>Baronian</hi> change from excuſing <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this cauſe, that upon the admiſſion thereof it doth inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enſue, both that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was an hereticke and a definer of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and that all who defend the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibitie,</hi> in cauſes of faith, that is, al who are members of their preſent Romane Church, to bee not onely heretickes, and for ſuch condemned and accurſed, but defenders alſo of a condemned and accurſed hereſie, even by the infallible judgement and decree of Pope <hi>Vigilius.</hi>

               <p n="16">16. Now in ſtead of a better concluſion to this Chapter, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the reader to obſerve with me two things touching their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this manner. The former is, what an happie thing it is to be a Pope, or have a Cardinall for his ſpokeſman. Let <hi>Luther, Cranmer,</hi> or a Proteſtant make farre leſſe change the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did <hi>Vigilius,</hi> what ſhall they not heare? An Apoſtate, unconſtant, inconſiderate, a Chamelion, a Polipus, another Proteus, even <hi>Vertumnus</hi> himſelfe. Let the Pope ſay and gaineſay the ſame doctrine of faith, and then <hi>ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra</hi> define both his ſayings being contradictorie, to bee not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, but <hi>infallible</hi> truths of the Catholike faith: O, It is all done with rare wiſdome, with great reaſon, and conſideration, The Pope in all this deales wiſely, and that in the ſuperlative degree. If when he is abſent from the Emperor, he oppugne the truth publiſhed by the Emperors edict, It is wiſely done; Kings and Emperors may not make Lawes in cauſes of faith, no not for the faith; The Cobler muſt not goe beyond his latcher. If when hee is brought before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he ſing a new ſong, and ſay juſt as the Emperor ſaith, <hi>Ait, aio: Negat, nego:</hi> It is wiſely done, <hi>principibus placuiſſe viris,</hi> for the Kings wrath is the meſſenger of death. If after both theſe hee become a meere Neutraliſt and Ambodexter in faith, holding communion with all ſides, Catholikes, heretickes, and all, this is alſo an act of rare wiſdome, the Pope is now become another Saint <hi>Paul, factus eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia omnibus,</hi> with Catholikes he's a Catholike, that he may gaine Catholikes, with Heretickes, he's an Hereticke, that he may gaine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, he's all with all, that hee may gaine them all. If when the Emperor, the generall Councell, the whole Church calls for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in a cauſe of faith, if then hee ſtep into his <hi>infallible</hi> Chaire, and thence by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authoritie define, that the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> that is, that Neſtorianiſme ſhall for ever bee held for the Catholike faith, O wiſely done, he now drops oracles from heaven, <hi>in Cathedra ſedet,</hi> the voice of God, and not of man. If, when hee is baniſhed for his obſtinacie againſt the truth, upon ſome urgent cauſe which then he diſcernes, he calls againe for his holy Trevit, and thence decrees the quite contradictorie to his former <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſentence, In this he's wiſer then in all the reſt: for by this he ſhews that he's more wiſe and powerfull then all the Prophets and Apoſtles ever were; They ſilly men could make but the one part of a contradiction to be true, but the Pope he is <hi>tanto</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Tanto ipſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentior eſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetis effectus, quanto differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius prae illis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Nam cui prophetarum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando dictu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt, Tu es Petra? Bar. an. <hi>552.</hi> nu. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>potentior Prophetis, ſo much more wiſe and powerfull then all the Prophets,</hi> that hee can make both parts of a contradiction to be <hi>infallible</hi> truths; and unto which of the Prophets was it ever ſaid, <hi>Tu es Petra?</hi> But the Pope is a Rocke indeed, a Rocke upon which you may build two contradictories in the doctrine of faith, and in them both ſay unto him, <hi>Tu es Petra.</hi> Such a Rocke neither the Prophets, nor Apoſtles, nor Chriſt himſelfe ever was. So wiſe, ſo exceeding wiſe is the Pope, in all his turnings, even as wiſe as a wethercocke for turning with the wind and weather.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Againe, when the Pope, his inſtruments or Inquiſitors (to whom <hi>Phalaris, Buſiris,</hi> and all the heathen perſecutors may yeeld)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7680:124"/> exerciſe againſt us for maintaining the truth of God, all exquiſite &amp; helliſh tortures (to which the old heatheniſh were but <hi>ludus &amp; jocus</hi>) all which they doe muſt be extolled as due puniſhments, and juſt cenſures of the Holy Father of the holy Church, of the Holy inquiſition, of the Holy houſe, all muſt bee covered with the mantle of holineſſe. On the other ſide, when they reſiſt the moſt religious lawes, or Edicts of Kings or Emperors, when <hi>Vigilius</hi> or any of them (being by an holy generall Councell declared, and condemned for an Hereticke,) are for their obſtinate rebellion againſt the truth juſtly puniſhed, though <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> yea Iuſtice it ſelfe, ſhall uſe rather moderate then ſevere correction againſt them; they forſooth muſt be accoumpted catholikes: Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſers, &amp; holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, ſuch as ſuffer for religion, for the ſacred lawes, and for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith; but <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Defender of the faith, muſt be called <hi>Iulian,</hi> Iuſtice be termed <hi>Scelus</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Vidiſti Scelus, &amp;c. Bar. an. <hi>554.</hi> nu. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>, and the Church for that cauſe ſaid to bee in farre worſe condition, then in the times of <hi>Nero, Diocleſian,</hi> or any of the heathen Tyrants. Such an happie thing it is to bee a Pope, or Papiſt, for then their wavering ſhall be Conſtancie; their rebellion, Religion and fortitude: their folly, greate and rare wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: their hereſie, Catholike doctrine: and their moſt condigne puniſhments ſhall be crowned with Martyrdome.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The other thing which I obſerve, is, what a ſtrong faith, Papiſts had need to have, who rely upon the Popes judgement, which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out and in, in and out ſo many times: who yet are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve al the Pope <hi>definitive</hi> ſentences in cauſes of faith, that is, to ſpeake in plaine tearmes, who are bound to beleeve two contradictories to bee both true, both of them the infallible oracles of God. Or if any of them have ſo weake a faith, that he can but beleeve the one, I would gladly learne of ſome who is an <hi>Oedipus</hi> among them, In this caſe of two Contradictorie <hi>Cathedrall</hi> decrees, ſuch as were theſe of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> whether of the Popes definitive judgements, that is, according to their language, whether of the ſayings of God is true, and whether falſe, or what ſtrength the one hath, more then the other. If the Apoſtolicall ſentence of <hi>Vigilius</hi> delivered <hi>cum omni undique cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tela,</hi> and by his Cathedrall authoritie, in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> be repealeable by a ſecond, why may not the ſecond (which cannot poſſibly have more authoritie) bee repealed by a third, and the third by a fourth, and fourth by a fift, and ſo <hi>in Infinitum?</hi> If the Pope after ſeaven yeares deliberation and ventilating of the cauſe, while hee is all that time in peace, and libertie, may be deceived in his judiciall and Cathedrall ſentence in a cauſe of faith, how may wee be aſſured, that when ſome yeares after that, the tediouſneſſe of exile and deſire of his priſtine libertie and honour perſwades him to make a contrary decree, he may not therein alſo bee deceived? If the Popes decrees made in libertie, peace and proſperity be of force, why ſhall not the decree of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> be an article of faith? If thoſe free decrees may be admitted by a ſtronger ſentence when the Pope is in baniſhment, how may any beleeve their <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> decrees, as doctrines of faith? For why may there not once
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7680:124"/> againe, come ſome other <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> into the world, (as great pitie it is but there ſhould) who in theſe, or future times may miniſter that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne medicine to cleare the Popes judgement, and reſtraine, or cloſe him up in ſome meaner eſtate, and farre lower place, whence, as out of a darke and low pit, he may diſcerne thoſe coeleſtiall truths in the Word of God, like ſo many Starres in heaven, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invironed with the circumfuſed ſplendor of the Romane Court, he cannot poſſibly behold. If thoſe <hi>Three Chapters</hi> were to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, why did the Pope defend them at the time of the Councell? If they were to be defended, why did he condemne them after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from exile? Nay, if the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> were <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> why did the Pope at any time firſt or laſt by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them? If they were <hi>hereticall,</hi> why did he at any time, firſt or laſt, by his <hi>Cathedrall</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſentence defend them? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I am here in a Labyrinth; if any of the Cardinals friends will winde mee out, he ſhall for ever be <hi>Theſeus</hi> unto me.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Concerning which, none I thinke can judge otherwiſe, but that <hi>Baronius,</hi> as he is miſerably infatuated in this whole cauſe of the <hi>Three Chapters;</hi> ſo, in this paſſage, hee was growne to that extremity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that hee ſeemes utterly to have beene bereft, both of common ſenſe, and reaſon: For I doe conſtantly avouch, that in no part of all this his narration, (which, as you ſee, is very large and copious, and runneth, like a great ſtreame, through divers yeares in <hi>Baronius</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals) there is any truth at al. No ſuch Decree of <hi>Taciturnity,</hi> ever made by <hi>Vigilius;</hi> no Synod wherein it was decreed; no aſſent, either of <hi>Mennas,</hi> or <hi>Theodorus,</hi> or the Emperour unto it; no violating of that Decree by <hi>Mennas,</hi> or <hi>Theodorus;</hi> no excommunication of them, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops, for doing contrary to it; no hanging up of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Edict after it; no reſiſtance made by <hi>Vigilius</hi> againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; no perſecuting of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> no buffeting of him, no objecting of murder unto him; no fleeing either to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, or to <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> no thundring out from thence of his Pontificall Cenſures; no embaſſage ſent from the Emperour to call him thence; no ſuch magnanimitie in <hi>Vigilius</hi> as to refuſe to returne; no recalling, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating of the Emperiall Edict by the Emperour; no ſubmiſſion of <hi>Mennas,</hi> or <hi>Theodorus</hi> to the Pope; no ſolemnizing of the <hi>Encaenia</hi> for thoſe three Apoſtles at that time by <hi>Mennas;</hi> no carying of thoſe holy reliques in a triumphing manner, and in a golden Chariot; no laying them up by <hi>Mennas;</hi> and, in a word, in that whole paſſage of <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> there is not ſo much as one dramme, nor one ſyllable of truth. The Cardinall from an Hiſtorian is here quite metamorphozed into a Poet, into a Fabler, and in ſtead of writing Annals, matters of fact, and reall truths, he guls his readers with fictitious, anile, and more than <hi>Aeſopicall</hi> fables.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For the clearing whereof I will begin with the Decree it ſelfe, which is the ground of the whole fiction, and therefore if it bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to bee but an idle dreame and fancie, all the reſt, which hang on it like ſo many conſequents, and appendices, will of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fall to the ground. Nor doe I ſpeake to diſgrace this Decree, as if <hi>Baronius</hi> could gaine ought thereby, though it were admitted and granted unto him: For alas, what a poore pollicy or peece of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was this in the Pope, being a Iudge <hi>infallible,</hi> to command, and decree by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authority, that for five or ſixe, or, as it might have hapned, for forty or ſixty yeares together, no man ſhould ſpeake a word in this cauſe of faith, neither condemne the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> nor defend the ſame; which is in effect, that they ſhould neither ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, nor for Neſtorianiſme; neither dare to ſay, that Chriſt is God, nor, that he is not God, but ſuſpend their judgement in them both; that for all that time none ſhould either be Catholikes, or heretikes,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7680:126"/> but be like <hi>Vigilius,</hi> meere Neutraliſts in the faith, what other wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is this but that of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> which Chriſt condemneth<note n="u" place="margin">

True, but that is not enough; He ſhould have defended it alſo, and cauſed others by his inſtruction and example to doe the like. A neutraliſt, <hi>one that is not</hi>

                  <hi>with Chriſt, is againſt Chriſt:</hi> Hee that is not with the truth is againſt the truth. Silence where God commands to ſpeake, is betraying of Gods truth. If the Heathen wiſe man<note n="z" place="margin">Solonis lex apud A. Gellium lib. <hi>2.</hi> ca. <hi>12.</hi>

Did not <hi>Vigilius,</hi> if the Cardinall ſay true, teach, nay decree the very like ſilence concerning the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> as <hi>Domnus</hi> did concerning thoſe twelve of <hi>Cyrill?</hi> Theſe Three doe as nearly concerne the faith, as did the other twelve. Theſe three were as certainly condemned by the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as the other twelve were approved by the Councell of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> As <hi>Domnus</hi> by teaching ſilence in thoſe of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> even thereby taught that men ſhould not allow them, nor ſay that they might be allowed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in overthrew the faith of the Epheſine Councell, which approved them, and taught all men to approve them: Even ſo, <hi>Vigilius</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing ſilence in theſe <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> decreeth that none ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, or ſay they are to be condemned, and ſo overthroweth the Catholike faith which was declared at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> whereby they are all three condemned, and taught that they ought to bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If the teaching of ſilence in the one can make <hi>Domnus</hi> an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, certainly the decreeing of ſilence in the other, cannot chuſe but make <hi>Vigilius</hi> an heretike. O but this decree was to continue but for a time, <hi>Vigilius</hi> would expect the aſſembling of a generall Councell, and then he would reſolve the matter to the full. And you have ſeen how well he reſolved it then. But what? Expect a Councell? why is not his Holineſſe able to decide a doubt in faith, without a generall Councell? Is he not of himſelfe infallible? Doth his infallibilitie like an Ague goe away, and come by fits upon him? Is the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that Angell which muſt move the Pole in the Popes breſt, before he can teach infallibly? The Pope ſcornes to hold his infallibility
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7680:127"/> 
                  <hi>precario,</hi> by the curteſie either of the whole Church, or of any generall Councell: He is all-ſufficient in himſelfe, he gives to them <hi>infallibility,</hi> he receives none from them; what thinke you then was become of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his infallibility, that for deciding a doubt in faith, hee muſt ſuſpend all in ſilence; and ſtay till the generall Councel be aſſembled, which, for ought he knew, might bee 60. or 100. yeares after? If of himſelfe he was infallible, why did he hold men in ſuſpence in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith? why did he not preſently, and without the Councell infallibly decide it, and ſo ſet the Church at quiet? If of himſelfe he was not infallible, how could he at the time of the Councell infallibly decide it? for they make not him or his ſentence infallible, but all their infallibility is borrowed from him. So little helpe is there for them in this decree of taciturnity, (if wee ſhould admit thereof) that in very deed, it doth many wayes prejudice their cauſe. It is not then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of any advantage which hence they might have, that cauſeth me to reject this decree, but the onely love of the truth perſwadeth, nay enforceth me hereunto. For I profeſſe I was not a little moved to ſee the Cardinalls Annalls ſo ſtuffed with untruths and figments, and ſee him alſo not onely by theſe to abuſe, and that moſt vilely, his Readers, but even to vaunt and glory (as you have ſeene hee doth) in that which is, and will be an eternall ignominy unto him. But let us come to make evident the fiction of this Decree.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That <hi>Vigilius</hi> made no ſuch decree of <hi>Taciturnitie,</hi> firſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> in his Letters to the fift generall Councell is a witnes above exception, <hi>When Pope</hi> Vigilius, ſaith he<note n="c" place="margin">Iuſtin.

Quod vero ejuſdem voluntatis ſemper fuit de condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione trium Capitulorum, per plurima declaravit, and that he hath alwayes,</hi> (ever ſince his comming hither) <hi>continued in the ſame minde of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe three Chapters, he hath very many wayes declared.</hi> And after, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating ſome of thoſe particulars, hee adds, <hi>Et compendioſè dicere, ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in eadem voluntate perſeveravit, and to ſpeake briefly, he hath ever ſince perſevered in this minde.</hi> So writ and teſtified the Emperour. In the ſeventh Collation the Emperour ſent <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the moſt glorious Quaeſtor of his Palace, unto the Synod, to deliver unto them certaine letters of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> who againe teſtified this from the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Councell: <hi>Vigilius,</hi> ſaith he<note n="c" place="margin">Coll. <hi>7.</hi> Conc. <hi>5.</hi> pa. <hi>578.</hi> a.</note>, <hi>hath very often manifeſted by writings his minde, that he condemneth the Three Chapters, which alſo without writing, he hath ſaid before the Emperour in the preſence of the moſt glorious Iudges, and of very many of your ſelves, who are here in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: et non intermiſit, ſemper anathematizans Theodorum, and hee hath not intermitted or ever ceaſed</hi> (ſince his firſt comming almoſt to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople) to anathematize the defenders of Theodorus of Mopſveſtia, and the Epiſtle of Ibas, and the writings of Theodoret againſt Cyrill:</hi> and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the letters of <hi>Vigilius</hi> unto them, he addeth, <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth by theſe make manifeſt, <hi>quod per totum tempus, eorundem trium Capituloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impietatem averſatur, that for this whole time</hi> (ſince his firſt conſenting to

               <p n="8">8. If I ſhould ſay no more at all, even this one teſtimony being ſo pregnant, and withall ſo certaine, that there can bee no doubt but the Emperor both knew and teſtified the truth herein, this alone, I ſay, is ſufficient to demonſtrate the vanity of that fictitious Synod &amp; decree of <hi>Taciturnity.</hi> For ſeeing it is hence certaine, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> perſiſted and perſevered to condemne the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> after the time of his conſenting to the Emperors Edict, upon his comming to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> till the time of the fift Councell; it muſt needs be acknowledged for certaine, that in that time hee made no decree to forbid men to condemne the fame; and then, not this decree of Taciturnity, which tyes all mens tongues that they ſhal neither defend, nor yet condemne them. And if the decree be fictitious, ſuch as was never made, as by this teſtimony it is now certaine: then is the Councell fictitious wherein it was decreed; then the whole fable of <hi>Baronius;</hi> how the Emperor and <hi>Mennas</hi> violated that decree, how the Pope indured perſecution for maintaining that Decree, and the other Conſequents, they all are certainly fictitious, this one teſtimonie overthroweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. But I will adde a ſecond reaſon drawne from the conſideration of the obſerving and putting in execution this Synodall and pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Decree. For it is not to bee doubted, but if ſuch a Decree had beene made, eſpecially, with the conſent of a Synod, and of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour alſo, but ſome one or other would have obſerved the ſame; the rather, becauſe <hi>Baronius</hi>

               <p n="21">21. Truly this was ſcarſe faire and honeſt dealing in the Cardinall, by untruths to ſtrive to bolſter out forged Acts and writing: But the Cardinals Annals are ſo full of ſuch like ſtuffe, that, if you divide them into foure parts, I doe conſtantly affirme there is no more truth in three of thoſe foure, than you have ſeene to bee in this fable, which from a moſt baſe forgery, knowne alſo to the Cardinall for ſuch, hee hath commended for a grave and authentike hiſtory unto us: And I ſhould grow ſomewhat out of patience to ſee the Cardinall ſo groſly contradict, both the truth, and his owne writings alſo, but that, by my long and ſerious toſſing of his bookes, I perceive this is ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar a tricke with him, that, for the uſuall meeting of it, I have long ſince forgotten to be angry with him for ſuch pettie faults. This I hope, which hath beene declared, will ſerve for a caveat unto all, to take heed how they credit any matter whatſoever upon the Cardinals relation: either it is in it ſelfe untrue, or it ſprings from ſome untruth, or by his purpoſe in relating it, it is made to ſerve but for a pully to draw you into ſome untruth, <hi>aut aliquis latet dolus, either in the header taile there is a ſting,</hi> beleeve him not.

                  </note> declared; but becauſe al which we then ſaid was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken upon a ſuppoſall and admiſſion of this Baronian change, we will now more nearly examine the whole matter, and try whether there was indeed any ſuch Decree ever made by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and whether he did at any time after the end of the fift Councell change his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſuch ſort, that he became a condemner of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and an approver of the fift Synod. And truly I could wiſh ſo much good to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as that there might appeare ſome cleare, and ancient records, to teſtifie his renouncing of hereſie, and condemning of his owne hereticall and <hi>Cathedrall decree,</hi> publiſhed in the time of the Councell, for defence of the <hi>Three Chapters:</hi> But the truth is more precious unto me than the love of <hi>Vigilius</hi> or any Pope whatſoever; &amp; becauſe it is the truth alone which cauſeth me to diſcuſſe this point, I muſt needs confeſſe, that I can finde nothing at all, which can effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally induce mee to beleeve it, but there are many and pregnant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which inforce me to thinke, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> never made any ſuch <hi>Decree</hi> or Change, as <hi>Baronius</hi> fancieth, but that this whole fourth Period and change of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> ſo gloriouſly painted out by <hi>Baronius,</hi> is nothing elſe but another fiction, and peece of the Cardinals owne Poetry, which, without all warrant or ground from any ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee, like a Spider, onely out of his owne braine hath woven and deviſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Vigilius</hi> made no ſuch <hi>Decree,</hi> the reaſon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                  <hi>Bar.</hi> gives in this very caſe, may declare: he, to prove that <hi>Vigilius</hi> made not this decree, either during the time of the Synod, or ſhortly after the end thereof, hath theſe words<note n="e" place="margin">Bar. an. <hi>553.</hi> nu. <hi>223.</hi>
                  </note>, If <hi>Vigilius</hi> had then aſſented by his letters, <hi>utique literae illae Actis fuiſſent intextae; verily thoſe letters, purchaſed with ſo great labour, would have beene inſerted among the Acts of the fift Synod, and a great number of copies would have been taken thereof, ſpred abroad, and made knowne to all Churches, as well in the Eaſt, as Weſt, (even as the Epiſtle of</hi> Leo <hi>was) becauſe by thoſe letters, validarentur quae à Synodo ſancita; thoſe things which the fift Synod had decreed, the Pope contradicting them, and thereby they being invalid, ſhould now be made of force, the Pope conſenting to them.</hi> Thus <hi>Baronius.</hi> Doth not the ſame reaſon as effectually prove,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7680:132"/> that he made no ſuch decree at al, or not a yeare after, as that he made it not within one or two moneths after the end of the Synod? with what labour, at what price would not the Biſhops of the fift Synod have purchaſed that decree? how gladly would they have annexed it to their Acts, as the Decree of <hi>Leo</hi> is to the acts at <hi>Chalcedon?</hi> How many copies and extracts would they have taken of it, and diſperſed them every where, both in the Weſt and Eaſt, to teſtifie the truth of their Synodall judgement, and that the <hi>infallible</hi> Iudge had conſented to their ſentence, and confirmed the ſame. Or would they have done this within a month, and not a yeare after the end of the Synod? what odds to the point in hand can that ſmall difference of time make in the cauſe? ſpecially conſidering that the very Epiſtle of <hi>Leo</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Ea eſt Epiſt. Leonis <hi>61.</hi> quae incipit, Omnem fraternitatem.</note>, whereof the Cardinall ſpeaketh, was not written till five<note n="g" place="margin">Conc. Chalc. deſijt <hi>28.</hi> Oct. Coſſ.

If then the Cardinalls reaſon bee of force to prove that hee writ not this Decree ſhortly after the Synod, it is altogether as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to prove he writ it not at all, nor after his returne about a year after out of exile.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Cardinall gives yet another evidence hereof, <hi>Pelagius,</hi> ſaith he<note n="h" place="margin">Bar. an. <hi>553.</hi> nu. <hi>236.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>the ſucceſſor of</hi> Vigilius <hi>did thinke it fit, that the fift Synod ſhould bee approved, and the three Chapters condemned, moved eſpecially hereunto by this reaſon, that the Eaſterne Church, ob Vigilij conſtitutum ſchiſmate ſciſſa, being rent and divided from the Romane by reaſon of the Conſtitution of</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius, <hi>might be united unto it.</hi> How was the Eaſterne Church divided from the Romane in the time of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> by reaſon of that decree of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> if <hi>Vigilius</hi> by another decree publiſhed after it had recalled, and adnulled it? If the Popes condemning of thoſe Chapters, and approving of the fift Councell could unite the Churches, then the decree of <hi>Vigilius</hi> (had there beene any ſuch) would have effected that union. If the <hi>Apoſtolike Decree</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> could not effect it, in vaine it was for <hi>Pelagius</hi> to thinke by his approbation, which could have no more authority then <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> to effect that union. If the cauſe of the breach and diſunion of thoſe Churches was, as <hi>Baronius</hi> truly ſaith, the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> againſt the judgement of the fift Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, ſeeing it is cleare by the Cardinalls owne confeſſion, that the diſunion continued till after the death of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it certainly hence followeth, that the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> which was the cauſe of that breach, was never by himſelfe repealed, which even in <hi>Pelagius</hi> time remained in force, and was then a wall of ſeparation of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne, from the Weſterne Church. Againe, if the Popes approving the fift Councell, and condemning the <hi>three Chapters</hi> was, as in truth it was, and as the Cardinall noteth<note n="i" place="margin">Cujus (Vigilij) poſtremam ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam (pro approbatione <hi>5.</hi> Conc. &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatione triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Capitulorum) poſteri omnes ſequuti, univerſa Dei Eccleſia paucis ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticis exceptis, eandem Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ut oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicam ſemper novit.

               <p n="7">7. For any <hi>Apoſtolicall Decree</hi> then, whereby <hi>Vigilius</hi> after his exile recalled his former judgment, or approved the fift Councell, there was none, as beſides thoſe reaſons which the Cardinall himſelfe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, the perſiſting of the Weſterne Churches in defence of thoſe Chapters, not onely after the death of <hi>Vigilius;</hi> but till the time of <hi>Pelagius</hi> the ſecond, makes evident. If <hi>Vigilius</hi> at all conſented to the Synod after the end thereof, it was onely by ſome private or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but not by any decretall or <hi>Pontificall</hi> approbation.

For as they teach, and teach it with oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as a matter of great wit and ſubtilty, that the Pope may erre <hi>perſonally,</hi> or in his owne perſon hold an hereſie, which onely hurts himſelfe, and not the Church, but erre <hi>doctrinally,</hi> or judicially define an hereſie he cannot, even ſo (to pay them with their owne coine) might it fall out at this time with <hi>Vigilius;</hi> hee being wearied with long exile, might perhaps for his owne perſon condemne the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and approve the Synod, which may be called a <hi>perſonall</hi> truth, or a perſonal profeſſion in the Pope, the benefit wherof
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7680:134"/> was onely to redound to himſelfe, either to free him from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Synod, or procure the Emperors favour, &amp; goodwill, that he might returne home to his See, but that this profeſſing (ſuppoſing he made it) was <hi>doctrinall</hi> or <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> delivered <hi>ex officio</hi> by the Pope as Pope, ſo that by it he entended to bind the whole Church to doe the like, neither <hi>Baronius,</hi> nor any of all his favourers can ever prove. Now were I ſure that the Cardinall, or his friends, would be content with this grant of a <hi>perſonall</hi> truth in Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> I could be willing to let it paſſe for currant without further examination. But alas, they are no men of ſuch low thoughts and lookes, their eyes are ever upon the Supremacie and <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> of the Popes judgement: As <hi>perſonall</hi> errors hurt them not, ſo <hi>perſonall</hi> truths helpe them not, <hi>Baronius</hi> will either have this conſent of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to bee <hi>Iudiciall, Doctrinall, Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi>

Seeing then, both the Emperours words, and the anſwer of the Clergy, as <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> relateth them, doe ſhew, that if they had pleaſed they might lawfully have choſen another Pope; and ſeeing they could not by right have done that, unleſſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his pertinacious defence of hereſie; even hereby it may bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that at his reſtoring he perſiſted in the ſame hereticall minde of which he was before, and that hee had not then conſented to the Synod, nor to the condemning of thoſe <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> So blinded was the Cardinall in this cauſe, that he could not, or rather would not ſee how his owne reaſon, drawne from the intreaty of <hi>Narſes,</hi> and the narration of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> doth quite overthrow the concluſion which by them he intended to confirme.</p>

Now, as the negative kinde of arguing diſproves the Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſo doth it alſo the Anaſtaſian baniſhment, and forcibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was not at all baniſhed, either before, or after the Councel; for there is no baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at all of <hi>Vigilius</hi> mentioned, either by <hi>Victor,</hi> or by <hi>Liberatus,</hi> or by <hi>Evagrius,</hi> or by <hi>Procopius,</hi> who all lived &amp; writ at that time, or by <hi>Photius,</hi> or by <hi>Zonaras,</hi> or by <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> or by <hi>Glicas,</hi> or by <hi>Conſtantinus Manaſſes,</hi> or by <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> or by <hi>Aimonius</hi> (though <hi>Sanders</hi> falſely affirmed them to teach this) or by <hi>Luitpran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> or by <hi>Bede,</hi> or by <hi>Krantzius,</hi> or by <hi>Mutius,</hi> or by <hi>Papirius Maſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> or by <hi>Caranza,</hi> beſides others.

That one example had graced the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> more than twenty, nay, than twenty hundred beſides, ſeeing by this it would have beene evident, that the Oracle of the world, the <hi>infallible</hi> Iudge had ſealed the truth of that cauſe with his glorious ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which is a kinde of Martyrdome. <hi>Anaſtaſius, Diaconus, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi> and all the reſt, who ſay he was baniſhed, ſhould have had the lye an hundred times at the Cardinals hands, for ſaying that he was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, either before or after the Councell, rather than Biſhop <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> who then lived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and was fellow-partner in thoſe troubles and baniſhments, ſhould have beene thought either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or forgetfull to expreſſe that baniſhment of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> had there beene truly any at all.</p>
               <p n="22">22.

You ſee now the weakneſſe, nay the nullity of the Cardinalls reaſon, even of his <hi>Achilles,</hi> drawne from the Emperours fact, in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or freeing him from exile, which he would never have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had conſented to the Synod. For, ſeeing we have proved that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was not at all baniſhed, it clearly thence enſueth, that neither <hi>Narſes</hi> entreated to have him freed from exile, neither did the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour upon that entreaty free him from exile, neither did <hi>Vigilius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Synod after his exile, and all the other conſequents, which upon this foundation of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his exile the Cardinall builds like ſo many Caſtles in the ayre, they all of themſelves doe now fall to the ground: and which I ſpecially obſerve, it hence followeth, that <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> did never after the end of the fift Councell conſent unto it, or to the condemning of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> either by his <hi>Pontificall</hi> decree, or by his <hi>perſonall</hi> profeſſion: for the Cardinall aſſures us, and delivers it as a truth, which of neceſſity<note n="t" place="margin">Neceſſe eſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmare.

               <p n="25">25. Now at that time it neither was nor could be, for there was never any ſuch time, nor was hee at all baniſhed, and therefore upon the Cardinals owne words we are aſſured that <hi>Vigilius</hi> after the end of the Synod never revoked his <hi>Conſtitution</hi> publiſhed in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> never after that time condemned the <hi>Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> or conſented to the Synod, either by any pontificall, or ſo much as by a perſonall profeſſion, but that hee ſtill perſiſted in his hereticall defence of the ſame Chapters, and ſubject to that cenſure of <hi>Anathema,</hi> which the fift Councell denounced againſt all the defenders of thoſe Chapters.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Some perhaps will marvell, or demand how it ſhould come to paſſe, that the Emperour, who as wee have ſhewed was ſo rigorous and ſevere in impriſoning, baniſhing, and puniſhing the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and ſuch as yeelded not to the Synod, ſhould wink at <hi>Vigilius</hi> at this time, who was the chiefe and moſt eminent of them all: which doubt <hi>Baronius</hi> alſo<note n="u" place="margin">Bar. an. <hi>553.</hi> nu. <hi>222.</hi>
                  </note> moveth, ſaying, he who publiſhed his Edict againſt ſuch as contradicted him, <hi>Num Vigilio pepercit, may wee thinke he would ſpare Vigilius,</hi> and not baniſh him who ſet forth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution againſt the Emperours Edict? <hi>Minime quidem:</hi> Truly the Emperour would never ſpare him, ſaith the Cardinall. Yes, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour both would and did ſpare him. Belike the Cardinall meaſures <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> by his owne irefull and revengefull minde. Had the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall beene croſſed and contradicted, nothing but torture, exile, or fire from heaven to conſume ſuch rebells, would have appeaſed his rage. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was of a farre more calme, and therefore more prudent ſpirit. <hi>Vigilius</hi> deſerved, and the Emperour might in juſtice for his pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reſiſting the truth, have inflicted upon him either impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or baniſhment, or depoſition, or death. It pleaſed him to doe none of all theſe, nor to deale with the Pope according to his deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> ſaw that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was but a weake and ſilly man, one of no conſtancy and reſolution, a very wethercocke in his judgement concerning cauſes of faith: that hee had ſaid and gainſayd the ſame
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7680:141"/> things, and then by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authority judicially defined both his ſayings being contradictory, to be true, and truths of the Catholike faith: the Emperour was more willing to pity this imbecility of his judgement, than puniſh that fit of perverſeneſſe which then was come upon him. Had <hi>Vigilius</hi> beene ſo ſtiffe and inflexible as <hi>Victor,</hi> as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratus,</hi> as <hi>Facundus</hi> were, whom no reaſon, nor perſwaſion would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to yeeld to the truth, its not to be doubted but hee had felt the Emperours indignation as well as any of them. But <hi>Vigilius</hi> like a wiſe man tooke part with both, he was an <hi>Ambodexter,</hi> both a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a condemner of the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> both on the Emperours ſide, and againſt him: and becauſe hee might bee reckoned on either ſide, having given a judiciall ſentence as well for condemning the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> as for defending them: it pleaſed the Emperour to take him at the beſt, and ranke him among the condemners; at leaſt to winke at him as being one of them, and not puniſh him among the defenders of thoſe Chapters.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Nor could the Emperour have any way provided better for the peace and quiet of the Church, than by ſuch connivence at <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and letting him paſſe as one of the condemners of thoſe Chapters. The baniſhing of him would have hardned others, and that far more than his conſent after puniſhment would have gained: the former, men would have aſcribed it to judgement; the latter, to paſſion, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his exile. But now accounting him as a condemner of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> if any were led by his authority and judgement, the Emperor could ſhew them, Loe here you have the judiciall ſentence of the Pope for condemning the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> if his authority were deſpiſed by others, then his judiciall ſentence in defence of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters could doe no hurt: and why ſhould the Emperor baniſh him if he did no hurt to the cauſe? nay it was in a manner neceſſary for the Emperour to winke at him, as at a condemner of the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> for he had often teſtified to the Councell, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both by words and writings thoſe Chapters, hee ſent the Popes owne letters to the Synod, to declare and teſtifie the ſame: thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well of the Emperour as of the Pope teſtifying this, were inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Synodall Acts<note n="x" place="margin">

Had the Emperour baniſhed <hi>Vigilius</hi> for not condemning thoſe Chapters, his owne act in puniſhing <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> had ſeemed to croſſe and contradict his owne letters, and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall Acts.

If <hi>Vigilius</hi> bee juſtly baniſhed as a defender of thoſe Chapters, how can the Emperours letters and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall Acts be true, which teſtifie him to be one of the condemners of thoſe Chapters? So much did it concerne the Emperors honour, and credit of the Synod, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſhould not be baniſhed at that time. <hi>Vigilius</hi> had ſufficient puniſhment that he ſtood now a convicted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and anathematized heretike by the judgement of the whole and holy generall Councell: but for any baniſhment, impriſonment, or other corporall puniſhment, the Emperour in his wiſedome, in his lenity thought fit to inflict none upon him.

                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for one, or as <hi>Victor</hi> ſaith, for moe yeares after the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, to the end that before he returned, the Synodall ſentence and Acts of the Councell being every where divulged, and with them, nay in them the judgement of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in condemning thoſe Chapters as the Synod did, might ſettle if it were poſſible, the mindes of men in the truth, or at leaſt ſerve for an Antidote againſt that poiſon, which either from the contrary conſtitution, or his perſonall preſence when he ſhould returne, could proceed.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And by this is eaſily anſwered all that the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> collect from thoſe great offices, gifts, rewards, and priviledges with which the Emperor graced and decked <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and ſo ſent him home: which the Cardinall thinkes the Emperour would never have done, unleſſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> had conſented to the Synod, and condemned the <hi>three Chapters.</hi> Truly theſe men can make a mountaine of a mole-hill. There is no proofe in the world that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was ſo graced at his returne: no nor that the Emperour beſtowed any gifts or rewards upon him at all.

Now it is true that the Emperour ordered and decreed thoſe matters upon the entreaty of <hi>Vigilius:</hi> for ſo the words <hi>pro petitione Vigilij,</hi> doe make evident: but that either <hi>Vigilius</hi> entreated, or the Emperour granted this upon any entreaty which he made, either after his return out of exile, (which certainly he did not) or after the end of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or at the time of his return (al which are the Cardinals tales with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proofe) none of the Cardinalls friends will bee ever able to make cleare. And for my owne part, till I ſee ſome reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I cannot otherwiſe thinke, but that this petition was made by <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſome three or foure yeares before the Councell, at which time <hi>Vigilius</hi> conſented wholly with the Emperor, was in great grace and favour with him. And I am hereunto induced by that which <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7680:142"/> for his government in the Weſterne parts: and this the Emperors anſwer then made unto them imports; who, as <hi>Procopius</hi> addeth, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, <hi>Italiam ſibi curae fore, that hee would have a care of Italy:</hi> but for that time hee was buſie in compoſing the differences about Chriſtian doctrines. The fift Synod then being ended, and all thoſe Eccleſiaſticall affaires concluded, nor that onely, but <hi>Totilas</hi> and <hi>Teias</hi> being both vanquiſhed, and ſo the whole dominion of Italy being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the victorious <hi>Narſes,</hi> the Emperour in his 28. yeare, which was next after the Synod, performed that promiſe which hee had made before to <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the other Italians, and according to their requeſt diſpoſed and ordered divers matters which in that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are ſet downe.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Now if the words of the Sanction have reſpect (as I verily thinke they have) to that time, then all that <hi>Baronius</hi> collecteth from granting that ſanction, and thoſe priviledges upon the petition of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> after his returne from exile, or after the Synod, are meere fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and dreames. Or if it were admitted (whereof I can find no proofe at all) that <hi>Vigilius</hi> made, and the Emperour granted unto him this petition after the end of the Councell, yet will it not hence follow that <hi>Vigilius</hi> then conſented to the Synod; for as wee have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the Emperour was not ſo eager, nor rigorous againſt <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but that upon his entreaty hee might grant to eſtabliſh thoſe Lawes, which being in themſelves ſo commodious and behoovefull, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any entreaty, upon the conſideration of thoſe matters, would in all likelihood have enacted.

Some would thinke this to be ſcarce currant dealing with his own witneſſe, to make him ſometimes more then a thouſand, ſometimes leſſe then a Cypher, but ſuch are almoſt all the Cardinalls witneſſes, they ſpeak not ſo much for him in one place, as they doe againſt him in others, nor is he ſo willing to accept them in one, as he is ready to reject the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in another.

               <p n="31">31. Thus one might if he liſted, elude his proofe, and make a little ſport with the Cardinalls Counters. But I will let the words of <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> ſtand in their beſt value; and to ſee the Cardinals deduction the better, wee muſt conſider the whole ſentence of <hi>Liberatus,</hi> which is this; <hi>Vigilius</hi> writing theſe things (to wit, that <hi>hereticall Epiſtle,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Eutycheaniſme</hi>) and that cloſely, to heretikes, continued ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, (in the See of <hi>Rome</hi>) In whom was fulfilled that teſtimony of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, they ſhall eate the fruit of their owne way,</hi> and they ſhall bee filled with their owne Counſells. <hi>Ab ipſa haereſi afflictus</hi> Vigilius, <hi>nec co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronatus, qualem vitae terminum ſuſcepit, notum eſt omnibus: Vigilius being afflicted by that hereſie, but not crowned, how hee ended his life, every man can tell.</hi> Thus <hi>Liberatus.</hi> In which words as you ſee, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all either of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his going into baniſhment, or returning out of baniſhment, or of his defending the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> or of his condemning the ſame Chapters, or of the Emperours either caſting him into, or releaſing him from exile, or of the fift Councell, or of the end thereof; and yet out of theſe words will <hi>Baronius</hi> like a very skilfull Chymick extract, both that <hi>Vigilius</hi> after the end of the fift Councell was baniſhed for defending the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and after that baniſhment, conſented to the Synod, and to condemne the <hi>three Chapters.</hi> And ſee I pray you how the Chymick diſtills this.

               <p n="32">32.

               </p>
               <p n="43">43. This will moſt clearly appeare, if we conſider that the Church and Eccleſiaſticall Writers doe mention as two ſorts, ſo alſo two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Catholike and Orthodoxall profeſſors. The one is of thoſe who are couragious and conſtant in defending the faith, ſuch as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endure torments, impriſonment, exile, and if need be, even death it ſelfe rather then they will renounce and forſake the faith, and theſe are called <hi>coronati.</hi> The other is of thoſe who being timerous, and faint-hearted, yeeld to deny the truth, rather then they will endure torments or death for confeſſing the ſame; and yet by reaſon of that immortall ſeed which is in their hearts, they returne againe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſſe that truth from which they had before lapſed: and theſe are called, <hi>Non coronati,</hi> ſaved by repentance, and returning to the truth; but by reaſon of their former faintneſſe, and lapſing, Not crowned. Both of theſe are Orthodoxall, and Catholikes, both of them placed in the bleſſed houſe of God, but not both in like bleſſed manſions and chambers of the houſe of God: <hi>For in my Fathers</hi>

Both of them bleſſed in the Kingdome of God, but the former not bleſſed onely, but crowned with bleſſedneſſe, the later bleſſed, but not crowned; neither with the Aureall Crowne of Martyrs, nor with the Lawrell garland of Confeſſors, yet ſtill, whether <hi>coronati,</hi> or <hi>non coronati,</hi> as they both dye in the profeſſion of the Catholike faith, ſo are they both rewarded with eternall glory for profeſſion of the Catholike faith. As for heretikes ſuch as die in hereſie, and out of the Catholike faith, they are to be ſorted with neither of theſe, they have another and a quite different ranke, <hi>Claſsis</hi> or <hi>Predicament</hi> of their owne. They may not have that honour done unto them, as to be called <hi>non coronati,</hi> which implies that they have a part in felicity, but not the Crowne. As the Church doth juſtly anathematize and accurſe ſuch, ſo are they to be ranked in the order of thoſe to whom Chriſt ſhall ſay,<note n="m" place="margin">

               <p n="35">35. Hence now it doth clearly appeare, that <hi>Liberatus</hi> in ſaying that <hi>Vigilius</hi> dyed <hi>Non coronatus,</hi> cannot intend as the Cardinall moſt ignorantly collecteth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> returned from the defence of the <hi>three Chapters</hi> to condemne the ſame; for that being in <hi>Liberatus</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a revolt from the truth, hee thereby had by <hi>Liberatus</hi> beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an heretike, and to dye in hereſie, and ſo had beene in the

Phy on ſuch a Plain-lie out of a Cardinals mouth; he doth not ſo much as obſcurely, not under a cloud or miſt, not any way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude unto it, nor intimate or inſinuate ought tending thereunto; nor could hee indeed, ſeeing, as we have before declared, that baniſhment of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is nothing elſe but a fiction, partly of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> partly of <hi>Baronius;</hi> and <hi>Liberatus</hi> was no Prophet, that hee could allude to their idle dreams: But if he allude not to his baniſhment, why then ſaith he that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was afflicted by that hereſie? as if there were no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world but baniſhment; what ere hee meant, he meant not that: And truly, whatſoever calamities or afflictions, either of body or minde, befell <hi>Vigilius</hi> after he had once conſented to the Emperors Edict, &amp; to the condemning of the <hi>Three Chapters;</hi> (which, in <hi>Liberatus</hi> account, was hereſie) and becauſe it was (as hee thought) contrary to the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> even the hereſie of the <hi>Eutycheans;</hi> all thoſe did <hi>Liberatus</hi> impute to that his revolt from the faith, and to that <hi>Eutychean</hi> hereſie which he then embraced, as <hi>Liberatus</hi> judged: Now there are two or three evident matters, which were great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and may well bee intended by <hi>Liberatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37. The firſt was the generall diſlike which the Italian, Africane, and other Weſterne Biſhops took againſt him, as ſoone as they knew that he had conſented to the Emperours Edict, they writ againſt him, as one who denyed the faith, and condemned the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> they cenſured, judged, and accurſed him by their Synodall ſentence; they contemned him as a temporizer; as one, who, to pleaſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, betrayed the faith: This was, no doubt, no ſmall affliction to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> to bee diſgraced, contemned, and accurſed by his owne friends, to whom, by ſo many bands of duty and love, he was ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjoyned; and this lay upon his ſtomacke for five or ſixe yeares together, even from his firſt comming almoſt, to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to the time of the Councell.</p>
               <p n="38">38. His ſecond affliction followed upon his change in the time of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7680:144"/> the Councell; for though hee then, by defending the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and publiſhing his <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitution</hi> for defence of them, hoped to recover the love and good opinion of the Weſterne Churches; yet hee exceedingly failed of that hope. Now hee was in farre worſe caſe than before; On one ſide he incurred the Emperours juſt indignation, and made himſelfe obnoxious to deprivation, baniſhment, death, or whatſoever puniſhments may bee inflicted on pertinacious, and hereticall oppugners of the faith; which, although the Emperour in his lenity did not, nor would inflict upon him; yet what a griefe is it to have all thoſe puniſhments hanging, like <hi>Damocles</hi> ſword, over his head, and ſure to fall upon him, if the Emperour at any time liſted to breake or cut the haire? What comfort could he have, who held not onely his dignitie, but his liberty; yea, his very life at the will and pleaſure of another? On another ſide he had incurred the heavie and juſt cenſure of the holy generall Councell, and of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, being by them adjudged and accurſed for an heretike. On a third ſide the Weſterne Churches, and the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters;</hi> were ſo farre from honouring him as he expected; that they alſo, for all that, held him for no other than an unconſtant and wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſon, one that turned his faith with every winde and weather: So, whereas at the firſt hee was beloved and honoured of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Churches, while hee defended the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> as they did; and after that was beloved and honoured of the Emperour, and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Churches, while hee, with them, condemned the <hi>Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> when now againe he returned to defend them, hee was contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both of the one ſort and the other; they all now eſteemed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him than a very Wethercocke. Now whether this, to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe forſaken and contemned by all, both friends and foes, both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and heretikes; whether this might not bee a corraſive to his heart, let any man duly conſider with himſelfe. Adde to theſe that corporeall anguiſh which cauſed his death; hee, if wee may truſt <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius,</hi>

               <p n="39">39. Thus all the reaſons of <hi>Baronius</hi> being manie wayes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declared to bee ineffectuall, to prove that laſt and Baronian change in <hi>Vigilius,</hi> after the end of the Synod, we may now ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as <hi>Vigilius,</hi> after his <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitution</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> once publiſhed, made at no time after that, any publike, judiciall or Pontificall Decree to reverſe and adnul the ſame; but that ſtill ſtood in full power and ſtrength untill the death of <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> ſo neither did hee ever after that time declare ſo much as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7680:145"/> diſlike thereof, or a perſonall conſent to the fift Councell, which had decreed the contrary; but pertinaciouſly perſiſting in that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, he both lived and dyed an hereticall defender of thoſe <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> At the firſt he was hereticall in defending them againſt the Emperours Edict: at the laſt he was not onely hereticall, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned heretike in defending them againſt the judiciall ſentence of the holy generall Councell. In the middle time he had a fit of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth, but that was only in ſhew, and in appearance, that ſo he might temporize with the Emperour, in heart hee was (as when the time of tryall came he demonſtrated himſelfe) an oppugner of the truth, both againſt the Imperiall Edict, and Synodall judgement: And therefore, as wee found him at the firſt an heretike; ſo, for all which <hi>Baronius</hi> hath ſaid, or could ſay to the contrary, we muſt leave him for a condemned heretike; even ſuch a one, as not only defended, but, by his <hi>Cathedrall</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> ſentence, defined hereſie to be the Catholike faith. And thus much bee ſpoken of the Cardinals third principall Exception, or troupe of evaſions, marching under that Act of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> which, by his manifold changing in this cauſe of faith, you have fully ſeene.</p>

                  </note> doe honour by the name of holy generall Councels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſay more, the expunging of all thoſe fourteene Councels, doth certainly follow upon the Cardinals aſſertion, though it were granted, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had confirmed this fift, as it is true, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> did: For if it was (as he teacheth) neither a generall nor lawfull Synod, while the Councell continued, and for that whole time while it was an aſſembly of Biſhops; then undoubtedly it never at any time was, nor yet is either a generall or a lawfull Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod: For after the end, and diſſolution thereof, it was never extant <hi>in rerum natura</hi> againe; it was ever after that time <hi>Non ens:</hi> and being neither Synod, nor yet ſo much as <hi>Ens,</hi> it could not poſſibly be either generall or lawfull. It is a Maxime, <hi>Non entis non ſunt Accidentia;</hi> If while it was extant, and while it was an aſſembly, it was but a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; if then it was not gathered in Gods name, I pray you, when was
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7680:146"/> it ever after that, gathered in Gods name? Did <hi>Vigilius, Pelagius,</hi> or <hi>Gregory,</hi> when they made it, by their approbation, a generall and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Councell; did they, like ſome new <hi>Aeolus,</hi> blow all the Biſhops againe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and aſſemble them the ſecond time in the Popes name, that ſo they might be ſaid to be gathered in Gods name? Let their Popes trie, if by all their magicall skill, or omnipotent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they can make any one of thoſe <hi>Africane</hi> Councels under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Generall; or make the <hi>Arimine, Syrmian;</hi> or ſecond <hi>Epheſine,</hi> a lawfull Councell, and I will inſtantly yeeld, that hee may doe the like to this fift. If hee cannot doe any of the former, what vanitie was it in the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> to ſay of this fift, that while it was extant, and <hi>Ens,</hi> it was neither a general nor lawful Councel; but ſome one, or ſome twenty yeares after, when it was <hi>non Ens,</hi> the Pope made it, with a word, both a generall and lawfull Councell? <hi>Dixit &amp; factum eſt:</hi> One word of his mouth makes, or unmakes what he liſt: Truth is, the Popes, or any other Biſhops approbation, or confirmation of a Councell, or any decree thereof, after the Councell is once ended, may perhaps in the opinion of ſome men, gaine ſome more liking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Councell, or decree, than before it had, ſeeing now it hath the expreſſe conſent of thoſe Biſhops, whom the other doe much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme: but the after conſent, or approbation of all the Biſhops in the world, much leſſe of the Pope, cannot make that to bee a generall, which before, and while it was extant, was onely Provinciall; or that to be a lawfull, which before, and while it was extant, was an unlawfull Synod: Even as the Pope, and a thouſand Biſhops with him, cannot now make any of the foure firſt generall and holy Councels, to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawfull or particular Synods; and yet his power is every whit as great in annihilating that which now is, as in creating that which never was a generall or a lawfull Councell.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Say you that the fift Councell was of no authority till the Pope approved it, and unleſſe he ſhould approve it? See how contrary the Cardinals aſſertion is to the conſenting judgement of the whole Church. Begin we with the Church of that age: <hi>Baronius</hi> tels<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 547. <hi>nu.</hi> 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 43.</note> us, <hi>that both the Emperour, the Pope, Mennas, and other Eaſterne Biſhops, agreed to referre the deciding of this doubt about the Three Chapters, to a generall Councell.</hi> Why did none of them reaſon, as the Cardinall now doth, againſt the Councell? Why did the Pope delude them with that pretence of a generall Councel? Why did hee not deale plainly with the Emperour and the reſt, who made that agreement, and ſay to this effect unto them? Why will yee referre this cauſe to the judgment of a Councell, it cannot decide this queſtion otherwiſe than my ſelfe ſhall pleaſe? If they ſay as I ſay, it ſhall be a Councell, a lawfull, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, an holy Councell: If they ſay the contrary to that which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, though they have ten thouſand millions of voyces, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſhall be utterly void, their aſſembly unlawfull, they ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee, nor bee called a generall, nor a lawfull Councell, no nor a Councell neither, but onely a Conventicle, without all authoritie in the world. Had the Emperour and the Church beleeved this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there had beene no fift Councell ever called or aſſembled; nay,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7680:146"/> there never had beene any other holy generall Councell: The Pope had beene in ſtead of all, and above them all. This very act then of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the judgement in this cauſe to a generall Councell, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them all (even the Pope himſelfe at that time) to have eſteemed the ſentence of the Synod to be of authority without the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to be of more authority, in caſe they ſhould differ (as in this queſtion they did) than the ſentence of the Pope. This before the Councell was aſſembled.</p>
               <p n="6">6. At the time of the Councell, had the Church or holy Synod which repreſented the whole Church, beleeved their aſſembly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pope to be no Synod, but a Conventicle; why did they at all come together after their ſecond Seſſion? for they were then aſſured by the Pope himſelfe, that he would neither come, nor ſend any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties unto them. Or had they beleeved that his definitive ſentence would or ought to have overſwayed others, ſo that without his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their judgement ſhould be of no validity, why did they after the fift Seſſion, once proceed to examine or determine that cauſe? For before the ſixt day of their aſſembling, they received from Pope <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his Cathedrall and <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitution</hi> in that cauſe, inhibiting them either to write or ſpeak (much more judicially to define) ought contrarie to his ſentence: or if they did, that he by his authority had beforehand refuted and condemned the ſame. Seeing notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this well knowne unto them, they not onely continued their Synodall aſſemblies, but judicially defined that cauſe, and that quite contrary to the Popes judgement made knowne unto them; it is an evident demonſtration, that the whole general Councell judged their aſſemblies both lawfull and Synodall, and their ſentence of full autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even as ample as of any generall Councell, though the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his preſence to the one, and expreſſely ſignified not onely his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but contradiction and condemnation of the other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What can pervicacie it ſelfe oppoſe to ſo cleare an evidence? or what thinke you will the Cardinall or his friends reply hereunto? Will he, or can he ſay, that theſe men who thus judged, were heretikes? They were not. The doctrine which they maintained was wholly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, <hi>conſonant</hi> (as they<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coll.</hi> 8.</note> profeſſe, and as in truth it was) <hi>to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to Fathers, to the foure former generall Councells.</hi> The doctrine which they oppugned, and <hi>Vigilius</hi> then defended, was hereticall, condemned by all the former, Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes then doubtleſs they could not be; that, like a leproſie did cleave to <hi>Vigilius.</hi> Will he, or can he ſay that they were Schiſmatikes? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that true. For they all even then remained in the communion with the Catholike Church: yea they were by repreſentation the true Catholike Church: I ſay further, they held communion even with Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> himſelfe, till his owne pertinacy, and wilfull obſtinacie againſt the true faith, ſevered him both from them, &amp; from the truth. In token of which communion with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> they earneſtly<note n="l" place="margin">Sup. cap. <hi>2.</hi> nu: <hi>1.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note> entreated his preſence in the Synod, they offered him the preſidency therein, yea they ſaid in expreſſe words unto him, before they knew his mind to defend the <hi>Three Chapters, Nos</hi>

So the judgement of theſe men being all Catholikes, and holding the Catholike communion, doth evidently prove the whole Catholike Church at that time, to have beleeved a Councell to be both generall and lawfull, though the Pope diſſented from it, and by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authority condemned the ſame, and the decree thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. After the end of the Councell did the Church then think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Did it then judge the Councell to want authority, while it wanted the Popes approbation, or to receive authority by his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation? Who were they, I pray you, that thought thus? Certainly not Catholikes, and the condemners of theſe Chapters. For they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Councel and <hi>Decree</hi> thereof during the time of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and while the Pope ſo far diſliked it, that for his refuſall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it, he endured baniſhment.

                  </note> of the Apoſtles, which they often op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to us, to take a Preſbyter of <hi>Oſtia</hi> at his ordination. So much did they diſlike both the fift Councell, and all (though it were the Pope) who did approve it. Now the whole Church being at that time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into theſe two parts, the defenders and condemners of thoſe Chapters, ſeeing neither the one nor the other judged the Synod to be generall or lawfull, becauſe the Pope approved it; who poſſibly could there be at that time of the Cardinals fancie, that the fift Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell wanted all authority till the Pope approved it, and gained autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a generall and lawfull Councell by his approving of it? Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and condemners of thoſe Chapters, embraced the Councell, though the Pope rejected it: Heretikes and defenders of thoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, rejected the Councell, though the Pope approved it. Neither of them both (and ſo none at all in the whole Church) judged either the Popes approbation to give, or his reprobation to take away au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from a generall Councell. Thus by the <hi>Antecedentia, Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitantia,</hi> and <hi>Conſequentia</hi> of the Councell, it is manifeſt by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church in that age, that this fift Councell was of authority without the Popes approbation, and was not held of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by reaſon of his approbation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What the judgement of the Church was, as well in the ages preceding, as ſucceeding to this Councell, is evident by that which we have already declared. For we have at large ſhewed<note n="r" place="margin">Sup. ca. <hi>4.</hi> nu. <hi>25, 26.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note>, that the doctrine, faith, and judgement of this fift Councell, is conſonant to all former, and confirmed by all following generall Councells, till that at <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth. Whereupon it enſueth, that this
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7680:147"/> doctrine which wee maintaine, and the Cardinall impugneth, (that neither the Popes approbation doth give, nor his reprobation take away authority from a Councell,) was embraced and beleeved as a Catholike truth, by the whole Catholike Church of all ages, till that <hi>Lateran</hi> Synod, that is, for more than 1500. yeares together.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And if there were not ſo ample teſtimonies in this point, yet even reaſon would enforce to acknowledge this truth. For if this fift Councell be of force and Synodall authority, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe the Pope, to wit <hi>Pelagius,</hi> approved it; then by the ſame reaſon is it of no force or Synodall authority, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe the Pope, to wit <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> rejected it. If the Popes definitive and <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> reprobation cannot take away authority from it; neither can his approbation, though <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> give authority unto it. Or if they ſay that both are true, (as indeed they are both alike true) then ſeeing this fift Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is both approved by Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and rejected by Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it muſt now be held both to be wholly approved, and wholly rejected: both to be lawfull, and unlawfull: both to be a generall Councell, and no generall Councell. And the very ſame doome muſt bee given of all the thirteene Councells which follow it: They all, becauſe they are approved by ſome one Pope, are approved and lawfull Councels: and becauſe they approve this fift, which is rejected by the Pope, they are all rejected, and unlawfull Councells. Such an havocke of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels doth this their aſſertion bring with it, and into ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable labyrinths are they driven, by teaching the authority of Councels to depend on the Popes will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now though this bee more than abundant to refute all that they can alledge againſt this fift Councell, yet for the more clearing of the truth, and expreſſing my love to this holy Councell, to which next after that at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> I beare ſpeciall affection; I will more ſtrictly examine thoſe two reaſons which <hi>Baronius</hi> &amp; <hi>Binius</hi> have uſed, of purpoſe to diſgrace this holy Synod. The former is taken from the aſſembling; the later, from the decree of the Councell. It was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſay <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Sup. hoc cap. nu. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Binius, Pontifice reſiſtente &amp; contradicente, the Pope reſiſting and contradicting it.</hi> Whence they inferre, that it was an unlawfull aſſembly, not gathered in Gods name. In this their reaſon, both the antecedent and conſequence are unſound and untrue. Did Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> reſiſt this Councell, and contradict the calling or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thereof? What teſtimonie doth <hi>Baronius</hi> or <hi>Binius</hi> bring of this their ſo confident aſſertion? Truly none at all. What probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties yet, or conjectures? Even as many. Are not theſe men, think you, wiſe &amp; worthy diſputers, who dare avouch ſo doubtfull matters, and that alſo to the diſgrace of an holy, ancient, and approved Councell; and yet bring no teſtimonie, no probabilitie, no conjecture, no proofe at all of their ſaying? <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> is in ſtead of all.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But what will you ſay if <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> will prove the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? If both <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> profeſſe, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did conſent that this Councell ſhould be held? Heare I pray you their own words, and then admire and deteſt the moſt vile dealing of theſe men. <hi>Hanc Synodum, Vigilius authoritate pontificia indixit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Binius</hi>

               <p n="14">14. Come now to the Conſequence. Say the Pope had reſiſted the aſſembling of this Councell; was it for this cauſe unlawfull, was it no generall Councell? What ſay you then to the ſecond Councell, of which <hi>Baronius</hi> thus writeth<note n="l" place="margin">

If not, why may not this fift alſo bee a generall and lawfull Synod, though <hi>Vigilius</hi> had with tooth and naile reſiſted the ſame? Shall the peeviſhneſſe or perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Pope, or any Biſhop hinder the aſſembling of a generall Councell, and ſo the publike peace and tranquillity of the whole Church?

               <p n="15">15. Had the Cardinall pleaded againſt this Synod, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had not beene called unto it, hee had ſpoken indeed to the purpoſe.

               <p n="17">17. The other objection of <hi>Baronius</hi> is taken from the decree of this Synod. The ſentence, ſaith he<note n="y" place="margin">

Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> explaines this more fully, ſaying<note n="z" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Conc. ca. <hi>11.</hi> §. Ac de.</note>, <hi>Such Councells as define matters againſt the Popes inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Reprobata Concilia dici debent, are to bee called or accounted, Rejected Councells; for it is all one, ſaith he, whether the Pope doe expreſly reject and reprobate a Councell, or whether the Councell deale, contra Pontificis ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, againſt the Popes ſentence, either of both ſuch Councells, are reiected, and ſo of no authoritie at all.</hi> So <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> What ſhall we anſwer to the perverſneſſe of theſe men? If this rule be admitted, the Church hath for ever and inevitably loſt this fift Councell, and (by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Nicen collection) the ſixt, the ſeventh, and all that follow. And I verily am perſwaded, that none can poſſibly excuſe either <hi>Baronius,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine</hi> from this crime of expunging the fift Councell, and all which follow it, from the ranke and number of generall, or approved Councels. For it is as cleare as the ſunſhine at noone day, that the ſentence pronounced by the fift ſynod was contradictory to the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and <hi>Cathedrall</hi> inſtruction ſent by Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> unto them. If

               <p n="18">18. Beſides this, ſee I pray you the zeale and devotion of theſe men to the Catholike faith. If this Councell be for this cauſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Councell, becauſe it followed not the inſtructions of Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> ſent unto it, then it ſhould have beene an holy, and approved Councell, if it had followed thoſe inſtructions of <hi>Vigilius;</hi> that is, if it had condemned the Councells of <hi>Nice, Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> if it had decreed <hi>Neſtorianiſme</hi> to be the Catholike faith, and Ieſus Chriſt not to be God: for <hi>Vigilius</hi> by decreeing that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to be defended, inſtructed them thus to define and judge. Had they thus done, then, becauſe they had followed the inſtructions of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> the two Cardinalls would have embraced this Councell, with both armes, have applauded, &amp; advanced it to the skies: ſeeing it did not ſo, but contradicted the Popes <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> inſtructions at this time; fie on it, it is an unlawfull, a Reprobated Councell, nay it is no Councell at all, nor of any authority.

So cleare it is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever decree is made by any Councell, the ſame is truly and rightly ſaid to bee confirmed by thoſe very Biſhops who make the Decree; confirmed I ſay, both by their joint conſent in making that Decree, and by their ſubſcribing unto it when it is made.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Vpon this confirmation or approbation of any Decree by the Biſhops preſent in the Councell, doth the whole ſtrength and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Synodall decree rely; and upon no other confirmation of any Biſhop whatſoever, when the Councell is generall and lawfull. For in ſuch a Councell, lawfully called, lawfully governed, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully proceeding, as well in the free diſcuſſing, as free ſentencing of the cauſe; there is in true account the joynt conſent of all Biſhops and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7680:153"/> Eccleſiaſticall perſons in the whole world. No Biſhop can then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that either he is not called, or not admitted with freedome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Councell, unleſſe that he be excommunicated, or ſuſpended, or for ſome ſuch like reaſon juſtly debarred. If all do come, they may and doe freely deliver their owne judgement; and that not onely for themſelves, but for all the Preſbyters in their whole Dioceſſe. For ſeeing the paſtorall care of every Dioceſſe, even from the Apoſtles time, and by them is committed to the Biſhop thereof, (all the reſt being by him admitted but onely into a part of his care, and to aſſiſt him in ſome parts of his Epiſcopall function) he doth, at leaſt (becauſe he ſhould) he is ſuppoſed to admit none, but ſuch as hee knoweth to profeſſe the ſame faith with himſelfe: whence it is, that in his voice is included the judgement of his whole Dioceſan Church, and of all the Preſbyters therein: they all beleeving as he doth, ſpeake alſo in the Councell by his mouth, the ſame that he doth. If ſome of the Biſhops come not perſonally, but either depute others in their roomes, or paſſe their ſuffrage (as often they did) in the voice of their Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan, then their conſent is expreſſed in theirs, whom they put in truſt to be their agents at that time. If any negligently abſent themſelves, neither perſonally, nor yet by delegates ſignifying their minde, theſe are ſuppoſed to give a tacit conſent unto the judgement which is given by them who are preſent; whom the others are ſuppoſed to thinke not onely to be able and ſufficient without themſelves to define that cauſe; but that they will define it in ſuch ſort as themſelves doe wiſh and deſire: for otherwiſe they would have afforded their preſence, or at leaſt ſent ſome deputies to aſſiſt them in ſo great and neceſſary a ſervice. If any out of ſtomack or hatred to the truth, do wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to come, becauſe they diſſent from the others in that doctrine, yet even theſe alſo are in the eie of reaſon ſuppoſed to give an implicit conſent unto that which is decreed, yea though <hi>explicitè</hi> they doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from it. For every one doth, and in reaſon is ſuppoſed to conſent on this generall point, that a Synodall judgement muſt bee given in that doubt &amp; controverſie, there being no better nor higher humane Court than is that of a generall Councell, by which they may bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Now becauſe there never poſſibly could any Synodall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given, if the wilfull abſence of one or a few ſhould bee a juſt barre to their ſentence; therefore all in reaſon are thought to conſent that the judgement muſt be given by thoſe who will come, or who do come to the Councell, and that their decree or ſentence ſhall ſtand for the judgement of a generall Councell, notwithſtanding their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence who wilfully refuſe to come.</p>
               <p n="27">27. If then all the Biſhops preſent in the Councell do conſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any decree, there is in it one of thoſe wayes which we have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either by perſonall declaration, or by ſignification made by their delegates and agents, or by a tacit, or by an implicit conſent, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting judgement of all the Biſhops and Preſbyters in the whole Church, that is, of al who either have judicatory power or authoritie to preach publikely; and therefore ſuch a decree is as fully authorized, confirmed, and approved, as if all the Biſhops and Preſbyters in the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7680:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> world had perſonally ſubſcribed in this manner, I confirme this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. Hereof there is a worthy example in the third generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. No Preſbyters at all were therein, not in their owne right. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Biſhops were perſonally abſent, and preſent onely by their Legates or Agents; as almoſt all the Weſterne Biſhops, and by name <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some, no queſtion, upon other occaſions neglected that buſineſſe; as, it may be, the Biſhops of <hi>Gangra,</hi> and of <hi>Heraclea</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who were not at this Councell. Divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wilfully and obſtinately refuſed to come to that holy Synod; as by name <hi>Neſtorius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople, Iohn</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> and ſome forty Biſhops, who at the ſame time while the holy Councell was held in the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> held a Conventicle by themſelves in an Inne, in the ſame Citie; and yet notwithſtanding the perſonall abſence of the firſt, the negligent of the ſecond, and wilfull abſence of the laſt, the holy<note n="x" place="margin">Epiſt. Conc. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. ad Imper. tom. <hi>2.</hi> Act. Con. Epheſ. epiſt. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> generall Councell ſaith of their Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall judgement, given by thoſe who were then preſent, that it was <hi>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil aliud quam communis &amp; concors terrarum orbis ſenſus &amp; conſenſus, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the common and conſenting judgment of the whole world.</hi> How could this be, when ſo many Biſhops, beſides three Patriarchs, were either perſonally, or negligently, or wifully abſent? How was there in that decree the conſent of theſe? Truly becauſe they all (even all the Biſhops in the world) did either perſonally, or by their Agents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe; or elſe in ſuch a tacit and implicit manner (as wee declared) wrap up their judgement in the Synodall decree made by the Biſhops preſent in the Councell.</p>
               <p n="28">28. But what if many of thoſe who are preſent, doe diſſent from that which the reſt being the greater part doe decree? Truly, even theſe alſo doe <hi>implicitè,</hi> and are in reaſon to bee judged to conſent to that ſame decree. For every one is ſuppoſed to agree on that generall Maxime of reaſon, that in ſuch an aſſembly of Iudges, what the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part decreeth ſhall ſtand as the Act and Iudgement of the whole: ſeeing otherwiſe it would be impoſſible that ſuch a multitude of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould ever give any judgement in a cauſe, for ſtill ſome in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe and pertinacie would diſſent. Seeing then it is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God that the Church ſhall judge, and ſeeing there can no other meanes be deviſed how they ſhould judge, unleſſe the ſentence of the greater part may ſtand for their judgement, reaſon enforceth all to conſent upon this Maxime.

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>pa.</hi> 306</note>, <hi>Foure Patriarkes being preſent, approved the ſame, and the moſt religious Emperour ſent the Synodall Acts thereof to Ieruſalem;</hi> where a Synod being aſſembled, all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Paleſtina, manibus, &amp; pedibus, &amp; ore, ſententiam Synodi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmarunt; they all confirmed the ſentence of this Councell, with their hands, with their confeſsions, and full conſent,</hi> except onely one <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Abyles,</hi> who thought the contrary, and therefore was put from his Biſhopricke; and comming to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ſwallowed up by an earthquake. So their Nicene Synod: By all which it is now cleare, that generall and appoved Oecumenicall Councels, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees thereof, may bee, and, <hi>de facto,</hi> have beene uſually approved and confirmed not onely by the Pope, but by other ſucceding generall Councels, by Provinciall Synods, yea, by particular Biſhops, who have beene abſent, none of all, which gave, or could give more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Councell or Synodall decree thereof, than it had before; and ſome of them are both in authority and dignity not once to bee compared to thoſe Synods which they doe approve or confirme; and yet not any one of al theſe confirmations were needleſſe, or fruitleſſe.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The reaſon of all which may be perceived by the divers ends of thoſe two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmations. Theſe uſe &amp; end of the firſt confirmation by the Biſhops preſent in the Councell, was judicially to determine and define the controverſie then propoſed, and to give unto it the full and perfect authority of a Synodall Oecumenicall decree, that is in truth, the whole ſtrength and authority which all the Biſhops and Churches in the whole world could give unto it. The uſe and end of the ſecond confirmation by thoſe Biſhops, who were abſent, was not judicially to define that cauſe, or give any judgment therein, (for this was done already, and in as effectuall a manner as poſſible it could bee) but to preſerve the peace of the Church, and unity in faith, which could by no other meanes be better effected, than if Biſhops, who had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and therefore did but <hi>implicitè,</hi> or by others, conſent to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees at the making thereof, did afterwards declare their owne expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and expreſſe conſent to the ſame. Now becauſe the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent that any Biſhop was, either for authority or learning, the more likely he was, either to make a rent and ſchiſme in the Church, if hee ſhould diſſent, or to procure the tranquility and peace of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7680:157"/> Church, if hee ſhould conſent; hence it was, that if any Patriarke, Patriarchall Primate, or other eminent Biſhop were abſent at the time of the Councell, the Church and Councell did the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly labour to have his expreſſe conſent and confirmation to the Synodall decrees: This was the cauſe why both the religious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Theodoſius</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Sacra Imper. ad Iohan. to. <hi>5.</hi> Act. Eph. Conc. ca. <hi>3.</hi> Cyril. Epiſt. <hi>38.</hi> ad Dynatum to. cod. ca. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note>, and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> with other orthodoxall Biſhops, were ſo earneſt to have <hi>Iohn</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to conſent to the holy <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſine</hi> Synod, which long before was ended; that as he had beene the ringleader to the factious conventicle, and thoſe who defended <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> with his hereſie; ſo his yeelding to the truth, and embracing the Epheſine Councell, which condemned <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> might draw many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe the like, and ſo indeed it did. This was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall reaſon why ſome of the ancient Councels, as that by name of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> (for all did it not) ſought the Popes confirmation to their Synodall decrees; not thinking their ſentence in any cauſe to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, or their Councell no approved Councell, if it wanted his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or confirmation, (a fancy not dreamed of in the Church in thoſe daies) but wheras the Pope was never perſonally preſent in any of thoſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they account the 8 general Councels, the Synod thought it fit to procure, if they could, his expreſſe and explicite conſent to their decrees, that he being the chiefe Patriarch in the Church, might by his example move all, and by his authoritie draw his owne Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archall Dioceſſe (as uſually hee did) to conſent to the ſame decrees; whereas, if he ſhould happen to diſſent (as <hi>Vigilius</hi> did at the time of the fift Councell) hee was likely to cauſe (as <hi>Vigilius</hi> then did) a very grievous rent and ſchiſme in the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="37">37. There was yet another uſe and end of thoſe ſubſequent confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, whether by ſucceeding Councels, or abſent Biſhops: and that was, that every one ſhould thereby either teſtifie his orthodoxy in the faith, or elſe manifeſt himſelfe to bee an heretike: For as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the ſix generall Councels, and their decrees of faith did witneſſe one to be a Catholike in thoſe doctrines; ſo the very refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to approve or confirme any one of thoſe Councels, or their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of faith, was <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> without any further examination of the cauſe, an evident conviction that he was a condemned heretike; ſuch an one, as in the pride and pertinacie of his heart rejected that holy ſynodall judgement, which all the whole catholike Church, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member thereof, even himſelfe alſo had <hi>implicitè</hi> before confirmed and approved. In which reſpect an heretike may truly bee called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being convicted and condemned not onely by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth, and by ſynodall ſentence, but even by that judgment which his owne ſelfe had given <hi>implicitè,</hi> in the decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. The ſumme is this; The former confirmation by the Biſhops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Synod, is <hi>Iudiciall;</hi> the later confirmation by the Biſhops who are abſent, is <hi>Pacificall.</hi> The former is <hi>authoritativè,</hi> ſuch as gives the whole authority to any decree: the later (whether by ſucceeding Councels, or abſent Biſhops) is <hi>Teſtificativè,</hi> ſuch as witneſſeth them to be orthodoxall in that decree. The former, joyned to the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all confirmation, is <hi>Eſſentiall,</hi> which eſſentially makes both the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7680:157"/> an approved Councel, &amp; all the decrees therof, approved, ſynodal, and Oecumenicall decrees: the later is <hi>accidentall,</hi> which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Biſhop, doth much grace himſelfe, but little or nothing the Synod; and being denyed by any, doth no whit at all either diſgrace the Synod, or impare the dignity and authority thereof, but doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely diſgrace the partie himſelfe who denyeth it, and puls downe upon him, both the juſt cenſures of the Church, and thoſe civill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which are due to heretikes or contumacious perſons.</p>
               <p n="38">38. My concluſion now is this: Seeing this fift Councell was both for the calling generall, and for the proceeding therin lawfull, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; and ſeeing, although it wanted the Popes conſent, yet it had the concurrence of thoſe two confirmations, before mentioned; <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall</hi> and <hi>Imperiall,</hi> in which is included the Oecumenicall approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole catholike Church: it hence therefore enſueth, that as from the firſt aſſembling of the Biſhops it was an holy, a lawfull, and Oecumenicall Councell; ſo from the firſt pronouncing of their ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall ſentence, and the Imperiall aſſent added thereunto, it was an approved generall Councell, approved by the whole catholike Church; and ſo approved, that without any expreſſe conſent of the Pope added unto it, it was of as great worth, dignity, and authoritie, as if all the Popes ſince <hi>S. Peters</hi> time had, with their owne hands ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto it. And this may ſuffice to ſatisfie the fourth and laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which <hi>Baronius</hi> deviſed to excuſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> from hereſie.</p>

Of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome are lawfull, others unlawfull Synods, if we can finde what it is which maketh a generall and lawfull Councell, it will bee eaſie therby to diſcerne which are unlawfull Synods, ſeeing it is vulgarly and truly ſaid, that, <hi>Rectum</hi> is <hi>index ſui &amp; obliqui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That a Synod be generall and lawfull, there are three things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, and even eſſentially required, the want of any one of which is a juſt barre and exception, why that Synod is either not generall, or not lawfull. The firſt, which concernes the generalitie, is, that the calling and ſummons to the Councell be generall and Oecumenicall; ſo that all Biſhops be called, and when they are come, have free acceſſe to the ſame Councell, unleſſe for ſome fault of their owne, or ſome juſt reaſon, they ought to bee debarred: For if the calling to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Synod bee out of ſome parts onely of the Church, and not out of the whole, the judgement alſo of ſuch a Councell is but partiall, not generall, and the Councell is but particular, not Oecumenicall, ſeeing ſome of thoſe who have judicatory power are either omitted, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly excluded from the Synod: The want of this was a juſt exception taken by the Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> againſt that Councell of <hi>Antioch</hi>

               <p n="10">10. Come we to the times of the Goſpell. The power and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority to call Synods was ever in the Emperours and Kings, even in thoſe three hundred years while the Church was in moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous perſecution under Heathen Emperours: The right and power was in the Heathen as well as in Chriſtian Emperours; in <hi>Tiberius</hi> as well as <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> in <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as well as in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> or <hi>Iuſtinian.</hi> But that power which they rightly had, they did not uſe aright: not to call Synods to maintaine the faith, but to aboliſh Synods, Biſhops, Chriſtians, and utterly extirpate the Chriſtian faith. Now becauſe Chriſt had layd an abſolute neceſſity<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.16. Matth. 28.19.</note> upon the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, to feed, to teach, and maintaine the doctrine of faith; and ſeeing they could not doe this with the allowance, or ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence of the Emperours, who in duty ſhould have protected them in ſo doing, yea have cauſed them ſo to doe; this very neceſſity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced them, and was a lawfull warrant unto them, both to feed the flocke, preach the Goſpell, and to hold Synods in the beſt and moſt convenient manner that they then could, not onely without, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will and command of the Emperors, that higher command of Chriſt over-ruling theirs.

But as ſoone as Emperours began to profeſſe the faith, and to uſe their owne, and Imperiall authority, in aſſembling Biſhops for conſulting about cauſes of faith; the Catholike Biſhops knowing that from thence that law of Neceſſity was now expired and out of date, attempted not then to come to Synods uncalled, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to come when they were called; though ſometimes they came with an aſſured expectance of the crowne of Martyrdome before they departed; as in the Councels of <hi>Millane, Arimine,</hi> and <hi>Syrmium,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Arrian Emperour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> is moſt cleare.</p>

And by this may now eaſily be diſcerned wherein the lawfulneſſe or unlawfulneſſe of any Synod conſiſteth: For whereſoever to Imperiall calling, and Imperiall Preſidencie, there is added the rightfull uſe of that Imperiall authoritie, in ſeeing liberty, freedome, diligent diſcuſſion of the cauſes, and all due ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall order preſerved in any generall Synod, the ſame is, and ought to bee truly called a generall lawfull Councell: But what generall Councels ſoever have beene heretofore, or ſhall bee at any time hereafter, either aſſembled by any other than Imperiall, and regall authority, or governed for the obſerving of ſynodall order, by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Imperiall Preſidencie, or miſgoverned by the abuſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they all are, and are to bee eſteemed for no other than generall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Councels.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Suffer mee here to propoſe ſome examples of each kinde, partly in the ancient, partly in the later times of the Church: In the order of lawfull generall Councels, principally, and by a certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency above all the reſt, are the five firſt approved Councels to bee reckned: The firſt at <hi>Nice,</hi> the ſecond at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the third at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the fourth at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the fift at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Iuſtinian;</hi> unto theſe the <hi>Sardicane,</hi> and that at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under <hi>Mennas,</hi> are to bee added, like two Appendant Synods; the former to that at <hi>Nice,</hi> the later to that at <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> For the ſixt, which was
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7680:164"/> held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantinus Pogonatus,</hi> I am out of doubt, and doe firmely hold it to have beene both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and lawfull: But I mention it apart by reaſon of that ſcruple touching the Canons thereof; concerning which I intend, if ever I have opportunity, to make a ſeverall tract by it ſelfe. For their ſecond <hi>Nicene,</hi> and the next unto it, to wit, that at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the time of <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Hadrian</hi> the ſecond; beſides that there are juſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt their lawfulneſſe, in regard of the proceedings uſed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it may be juſtly doubted whether either of them may be eſteemed generall: ſpecially conſidering that the Councell at <hi>Frankford</hi> utterly condemned<note n="p" place="margin">Synodus qua ante paucos an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos ſub Irene &amp; Conſtantino con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregata, &amp; ab ipſis non ſolum ſeptima veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> univerſalis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat appellata ut nec ſeptima nec univerſalis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beretur, dicere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turve, quaſi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervacua in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ab omnibus (in Conc.

                  </note> that Councell which they call the eighth, held in the time of <hi>Hadrian</hi> the ſecond. Now although by the judgements of theſe two Councels, thoſe other which they reckon for the ſeventh and eighth be wholy repealed, and that moſt juſtly; yet if the authority of theſe Synods were omitted, there are ſo many and ſo juſt exceptions againſt the two former, that I am out of doubt perſwaded, that neither of them ought to ſtand in the order of generall lawfull Councels: nor will any, I ſuppoſe, judge otherwiſe, who ſhall unpartially examine the Acts of them, &amp; compare them with the hiſtories of thoſe times. If any at all after the ſixt be to be ranked in the number of generall and lawfull Councells, I would not doubt to make it evident, if ever I ſhould proceed ſo farre in this argument about Councels, that the Councell held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantinus Iconoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> (whom they incontempt have with no ſmall token of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty nicknamed <hi>Copronimus</hi>) that this ought to bee judged the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; that at <hi>Frankford</hi> the eighth; and that at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which even now I mentioned, held in the time of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the eighth, (or as ſome call him, the ninth) the ninth of that order. For both the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of all theſe three is by the beſt Writers acknowledged, and all of them were called by Imperiall authority, governed by Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſidency, and that in a lawfull, free, and ſynodall manner; as, if ever I come to handle the Councels of thoſe times, I purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. This rather for this time I thinke needfull to obſerve: that as a Councell may be generall, and yet not lawfull, ſo may one be both generall and lawfull, and yet erroneous in the decrees thereof: which one point rightly obſerved, ſhewes an exceeding difference betwixt thoſe five firſt generall Councels, with the <hi>Sardicane,</hi> and that under <hi>Mennas,</hi> and all the reſt which follow the fift Synod. The former which were all held within the ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, in the golden ages of the Church, are wholly, and in every decree and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, orthodoxall, and golden Councells, no droſſe, nor dramme of corrupt doctrine could prevaile in any one of them: and ſo they are, and ever ſince they were held, were eſteemed not onely generall and lawfull, but in every part and parcell of their decrees, holy and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall Councels, approved by all Catholikes, and by the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7680:165"/> Church. But in all generall Councels which follow that fift, which were held after the 600. yeare, and in thoſe times wherein droſs and corruption began to prevaile above the gold, in them all there is ſome one blot or other wherewith they are blemiſhed, and by reaſon whereof, although they be both generall and lawfull, yet are they not in every decree holy and orthodoxall, nor approved by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages of the Church. Such in the ſixt, is the 2. 52. and 53. Canons: in that under <hi>Conſtantinus Iconomachus,</hi> the 15. and 17. defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: in that at <hi>Frankford,</hi> their condemning of the fact of the <hi>Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſts,</hi> which (untill the decree for breaking them downe was repealed by the Councell at <hi>Frankford</hi>) was both pious, and warranted by the example of <hi>Hezekias</hi> dealing with the brazen ſerpent: In that under <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8. their denying of the holy Ghoſt to proceed from the Son: And theſe examples which I have now named, are all the examples of generall and lawfull Councels, which as yet have beene held in the Church.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Wee come now to unlawfull Synods: wherein it is very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, that of ſuch as are unlawfull by want of lawfull calling, there is no example in the ancient Church to bee ſound, nor more than a thouſand yeares after Chriſt. All that time not any generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell aſſembled without lawfull warrant. The Biſhops, no not they of Rome, were as yet growne to bee ſo inſolent and headſtrong as to come together without the Emperours <hi>Mandatum.</hi> And the very like might be ſaid of ſuch Synods as are unlawfull by want of Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſidency. During all that time no Biſhop, no not he of <hi>Rome,</hi> durſt intrude himſelfe into that Royalty and Imperiall right. As the Emperour called them all for a thouſand yeares, ſo was he by himſelfe or his deputies Preſident in them all. But of ſuch as were unlawfull by abuſe of that Imperiall preſidency, thoſe ancient times doe yeeld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant examples. Such among many was that at <hi>Millane,</hi> wherein <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who ſhould have preſerved order in all others, moſt of all in his owne ſelfe uſed ſuch violent and tyrannous dealing, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canon<note n="r" place="margin">Athan. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad ſolit. vit. agent. pa. <hi>228.</hi> b.</note> whereby he ruled the Synod, was his owne will: <hi>Quod ego volo pro Canone ſit; My will ſhall be your law:</hi> and the onely reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee perſwaded, was a moſt tyrannous <hi>Dilemmà, Aut ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi>

It is the authority by which thoſe Councels were gathered, not by whoſe conſent they were gathered; of which we doe now enquire. The authority whereby they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled was onely in the Pope, though to that authority Emperours and Kings conſented: and as they are not a little brag that the Pope could doe ſuch worthy acts by his authority; ſo are we ſo farre from denying him to have done this, that wee willingly profeſſe the ſame: but withall doe affirme, which inevitably enſues thereof, that even for this very cauſe all thoſe Councels are unlawfull, becauſe they were called by Papall, and not by Imperiall authority. This demonſtrates them to have aſſembled without lawfull authority, to have beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than ſo many great Routs and Riots in the Church, ſo many tumultuous and diſorderly Conventicles, ſo much more odious both in the ſight of God and men, as thoſe who tumultuouſly and without authority convented, ſhould have beene patternes of piety, obedience, and order unto others.</p>

                  <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Zachary,</hi> and their ſucceeding Popes to <hi>Leo</hi> the third, had by moſt admirable and unexplicable fraud &amp; ſubtilty, clipt the wings and cut the ſinewes of the Eaſterne Empire; themſelves firſt ſeizing upon the greateſt part of <hi>Italy,</hi> by the meanes of <hi>Pipin,</hi> and then erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new Empire in the Weſt, the Imperiall authority being thus infringed, the Eaſterne Emperour not daring, the Weſterne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the late curteſie received from the Pope, being not willing, and neither of them both being able now to match and juſtle with the Pope; this which was the great let and impediment to the Popes fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the diſcovering of the man of ſinne being now removed, there was no meanes to keepe out of the Church the hereſies which the Pope affected: then the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of hereſies being ſet open, and the depths of the earth, nay of the infernall pit being burſt up, hereſies ruſht in, and came with a ſtrong hand into the Church, and thoſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall doctrines which in ſix hundred yeares and more could never get head, paſſing as doubtfull and private opinions among a few, and falling but as a few little drops of raine, grew now unto ſuch an height and outrage, that they became the publike and decreed doctrines in the Weſterne Church. The Pope once having found his ſtrength in the cauſe of Images, (wherein the firſt triall was made thereof) no fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie nor dotage was ſo abſurd for which he could not after that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

The Imperiall authority being laid in the duſt, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under the ſole of the Popes foot, no meanes was left to reſtraine his enormous deſignes, or hinder him in Councels, to doe and define even what he liſted. And as the Imperiall authority which he ſo long time had oppreſſed, is in any kingdome more or leſſe reſtored, and freed from his vaſſalage; the other hereſies which aroſe from the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and decay thereof, are more or leſſe expurged out of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the ancient truth reſtored therein: Yea and ſtill, though but by inſenſible degrees, ſhall hee and his authority waſt<note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, till not onely all the ten<note n="b" place="margin">

You ſee now how unlawfull thoſe Synods are by reaſon of the defect of Imperiall preſidency: you will perhaps demand whether by the want thereof there happened any particular diſorder in them, or ought contrary to freedome and ſynodall order: whereunto I might in a word anſwer, that there neither was, nor could there bee ought at all done in any of thoſe ten Synods with freedome and ſynodall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

               <p n="40">40. You ſee now the ſeverall kinds of unlawfull Councells, as well by want of Imperiall calling, or of Imperiall Preſidency, as when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is wanting, by the abuſe of that Imperiall authority in the Synod. And though the unlawfulneſſe of thoſe ten later Synods doth now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be farre greater than of thoſe ancient Councells before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; ſeeing in all the ancient there was not onely a lawfull calling, but a lawfull preſidency alſo, both which were wanting in the other tenne; beſides the unlawfull proceedings which were equally in both, or rather farre worſe in the later: yet is there one eſpeciall difference that is principally to be remembred, which iſſuing from the former diverſity of unlawfulneſſe, makes a greater oddes than at the firſt one would imagine: and this it is: When the unlawfulneſſe of any Synod ariſeth (as in their tenne Synods it doth) from the want of the firſt condition, that is, of lawfull calling and authority to aſſemble and judge, be the conſultations and proceedings of ſuch Synods otherwiſe never ſo orderly, and their reſolutions never ſo juſt and true, yet for making of any Canon or Decree, or giving any ſynodall judgement, there is an invalidity in all ſuch Synods, and a meere nullity in all their Decrees, Canons, and Iudgements. They had no authority to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a Synod, much leſſe<note n="o" place="margin">Si legitima ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus non fuit, planum eſt nulla authoritatem potuiſſe habere: &amp; nullius robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſunt illius ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones.

                  </note> have they any authority to make a Law,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7680:173"/> or give judgement in that Synod. That which is invalid in the ſpring and originall, muſt needs in all the ſubſequent actions derived from thence, &amp; depending thereon, retain the ſame invalidity. And ſeeing it is neither multitude, nor learning, nor wiſdome, but authority which is the fountain and foundation of all Lawes, Canons, and Iudgements, where this authority is wanting in any perſon or aſſembly, it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for ſuch a perſon or aſſembly to make a law, give any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or pronounce any judiciall ſentence, as to erect an houſe in the ayre, or build without any foundation. And truly this toucheth at the quick all thoſe ten Councels, which wanting authority to aſſemble them, were no other but tumultuous, ſeditious, and unauthorized aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. There was no more ſtrength, validity, or vigour in any of their Decrees to binde as lawes, or ſynodall judgements, than there was in ſuch Edicts as <hi>Spartacus</hi> and <hi>Catiline</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> in this Kingdome ſhould have publiſhed and ſet forth: ſpecially in that which he like another Pope intended to be his fundamentall law, That all lawes ſhould proceed out of his mouth. Thoſe which they untruly call the Canons, Decrees, or Iudgements of thoſe Synods, are onely the opinions, reſolutions, and conſultations of ſo many ſeditious men which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vened and conſpired together in thoſe conjurations: ſynodall Decrees, or Eccleſiaſticall Lawes and Iudgements they were not, they could not be. In the head, they are nipt and tainted with a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of authority, they beare this tainture and nullity throughout eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part and parcell of their determinations.</p>
               <p n="41">41. But when the unlawfulneſſe of any Synod ariſeth (as in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councels at <hi>Arimine, Millane,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus</hi> it did) from the want of the other condition, that is, of orderly proceedings onely, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops being both lawfully called, and having a lawfull Preſident, the caſe is here farre different; their acts and ſentences though they bee unlawfull, yet are they truly judiciall, and have the authority of ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall judgements, and therefore doe binde others, though not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to accept them as true, yet with patience to ſubmit themſelves to their cenſures, till by like authority they be revoked, and repealed. Even as in civill Courts, though an unjuſt or partiall Iudge, either for feare, favour, hatred, deſire of lucre, or any other perturbation of minde, ſhall wilfully pervert juſtice and due proceedings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an unjuſt ſentence: yet is this act judiciall, and ſtands in force of a judgement, till by the like, or higher authority it be reverſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch an one had authority and rightfull power to judge and give ſentence in that cauſe, though he abuſed his authority to injuſtice and wrong: Right ſo it is in ſynodall and Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, when they are lawfully called and authorized to heare and judge any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, their want of due, orderly, and juſt proceedings makes their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unjuſt, and ſhewes them to be wicked and malicious conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors againſt the truth, but it doth not make the decree to be no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or no judiciall ſentence of a Councell. The corruption is now in the branch, not in the root: the abuſe of their authority makes not a nullity in their act: It hinders not them to bee truly and rightfully Iudges, but it demonſtrates them not to bee upright, good, and juſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7680:173"/> Iudges, it ſhewes their ſentence to be wicked and impious, but it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it not to be a judiciall ſentence. Whereof that one (among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) in the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Latrociny, is a cleare example.

               <p n="42">42. Such an exceeding great and moſt remarkable difference there is betwixt thoſe ancient and theſe ten later unlawfull Synods. Though both be unlawfull, yet in the former there was a binding force for a while, till they were repealed; but in theſe later there never was any power to binde any, either to accept their Decrees, or to undergoe their cenſures, becauſe <hi>ab initio</hi> there was a meere nullity in all their Acts. Againe, the inflicting of any puniſhment upon the judgement of the former, had the warrant, though not of divine, yet of humane authority, and was to bee preſumed as juſt, (the ſentence of every Iudge, even <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe he is a Iudge, being to bee preſumed juſt, untill upon evident proofe it bee declared to bee unjuſt.) But what cenſures or puniſhments ſoever are, or at any time have beene denounced or inflicted on any, upon the warrant or Iudgement of theſe laſt ten Synods, they are all <hi>ab initio</hi> meerely tyrannous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, inflicted without any either divine or humane authority, (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Synods had none at all) there is not ſo much as a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they were or could be juſt, but for their want of authority in decreeing them, they are (though otherwiſe equall) preſumed to be unjuſt.</p>
               <p n="43">43. And thus much I have thought good to inſert concerning all ſorts of Councels, as well lawfull as unlawfull: to manifeſt hereby not onely the injurious dealing of <hi>Baronius</hi> with this fift Councell, againſt which he declameth as an impious and unlawfull conſpiracy; but their vanity alſo in extolling and magnifying many, and ſpecially thoſe laſt ten, for holy, lawfull, and oecumenicall Synods; of which dignity they are ſo farre ſhort, that they are all moſt deſervedly to be ranked with the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Latrocinie, and put in the <hi>Claſsis</hi> of thoſe which of all other are the moſt baſe, impious, unlawfull, and diſorderly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</p>

His ſecond reproofe of the Emperour is, for <hi>preſuming to make lawes in cauſes of faith; which for Kings and Emperours to doe, brings</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>an helliſh confuſion into the Church of God:</hi> The wit of a Cardinal! <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> may not doe that which King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which <hi>Aſa,</hi> which <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, the two <hi>Theodoſii, Martian,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy Emperours before had done, and done it by the warrant of God, to the eternall good of the Church, and their owne immortall fame: Had hee indeed, or any of thoſe Emperours taken upon them by their lawes to eſtabliſh ſome new, erronious, or hereticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Cardinall might in this caſe have juſtly reproved them; but this they did not: what doctrines the Prophets delivered, the word of God taught, and holy Synods had before decreed and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; thoſe, and none elſe did <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> by his Edict, and other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emperours, ratifie by their imperiall authority: Heare <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> owne words, <hi>Wee</hi>

See here againe the love and reſpect which <hi>Baronius</hi> beares to the Imperiall lawes, and to thoſe holy and religious Emperors, which were the nurſing fathers of Gods Church, and pillers to uphold the faith in their dayes. There are extant in the Theodoſian Code many laws co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Catholike faith; concerning <hi>Biſh.

The like titles are extant alſo in the Code of <hi>Iuſtinian.</hi> In the Authenticks there are I know not how many lawes in the like cauſes: Of <hi>the foure Councels, of the Order of Patriarchs, of the building of Churches; of goods belonging to ſacred places; Of the holy Communion, of Litanies, of the memorials for the dead, of the Priviledges of Churches, of Patriarchs, of the Pope of old Rome, of Archbiſhops, of Abbots, of Presbyters, of Deacons, of Subdeacons, of Monkes, of Anchorites, of Synods, of depoſing Biſhops who fall into hereſie, that Patrons who builded Churches, and their heyers ſhall nominate the Clerks for the ſame; and in caſe they name ſuch as are unmeet, then the Biſhop to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point who he thinks ſit, that Heretikes ſhall be uncapable of any legacies: and exceeding many the like.</hi> Now ſuch a ſpite hath the Cardinall to the Emperours, and theſe their Imperiall lawes, made concerning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Church, that like ſome new <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> with one daſh of his pen, hee takes upon him to caſheire, and utterly aboliſh thoſe lawes, (five or ſixe hundreth at the leaſt, with ſuch care, piety, and prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſet forth by <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Valentinian, Gratian, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Iuſtinian,</hi> and other holy and religious Emperours: And when theſe are gone, whether the Cardinall meant not after them, to wipe away (which with as good reaſon, and authority he may) all the other lawes, which are in the Digeſt, Code, and Authenticks, that ſo his maſter the Pope may play even another Iack Cade, that all law might proceed out of his mouth, let the judicious conſider.

                  <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> is of their number, who dye in the Lord, and are bleſſed: for of <hi>Them,</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> onely doth the holy Ghoſt ſpeake in that text, ſaying, <hi>They reſt from their labours, and</hi> Their <hi>workes follow</hi> Them.

But let us ſuppoſe the words to bee generall, as being uttered alone, without any reference to that text, they may bee truly affirmed both of the good &amp; bad: There cannot be found in al Scripture more faire evidence, nor a more authentike Charter for the happy eſtate of any one in particular that lived ſince the Apoſtles times, then is this for <hi>Iuſtinian:</hi> For what were thoſe <hi>workes which did accompanie and follow Iuſtinian?</hi> Truely the workes of ſincere faith, of fervent zeale to GOD, of love to the Church and Children of God, the workes of piety, of prudence, of juſtice, of fortitude, of munificence, of many other heroicall vertues: with theſe, as with a garment and chaine of pure Gold, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> being decked, was brought unto the Bridegroom; every decree made, or ratified by him for confirming the faith; every <hi>Anathema</hi> denounced againſt hereſies, &amp; heretiks, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe againſt <hi>Vigilius,</hi> &amp; al that defend him, that is, againſt <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and all who defend the Popes infallibility in defining cauſes of faith; everie Temple or Church, every Monaſtery and Hoſpitall, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City and Towne, everie Bridge, Haven and High-way, every Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Fort, and Munition, whether made or repaired by him, tending either immediately to the advancement of Gods ſervice, or to the maintaining or relieving of Gods ſervants, or ſtrengthning the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire againſt his and Gods enemies: every booke in the Digeſt, Code, and Authentikes; every Title, yea, every law in any title, whereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chriſtian faith and religion, or peaceable order and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, have beene either planted, or propagated, or continued, either in the Church or Common-wealth: all theſe, and every one of them, and many other the like, which I cannot either remember, or recount, are like ſo many Rubies, Chryſolites, and Diamonds in the coſtly garment, or ſo many linkes in that golden chaine of his faith and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.

They were not, nor could they looke into his heart; it was their duty to judge him to bee ſuch in deed, as he ſhewed and profeſſed himſelfe to be, a Catholike Biſhop: and taking him for ſuch; they placed him in that high Patriarchall See.

                  </note> Fox had ſo ordered himſelfe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt abominable heretike, <hi>Studeret tamen in omnibus apparere Catholicus, yet he endeavoured every way to ſeeme a Catholike,</hi> approving the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and all that true Catholikes did; yea and when there was a rumour ſpred of him to bee an heretike, the crafty companion throughly purged himſelfe of that crime, when in plaine termes he profeſſed before the Emperour, that he would in all things aſſent to what the Apoſtolike See did preſcribe: theſe things being diſſembled by <hi>Anthimus,</hi> his hypocriſie and hereſie were not dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, untill<note n="a" place="margin">Jbid. nu. <hi>88.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Agapetus</hi> the next yeare came to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> in the meane ſpace he was held for a profeſſor of the Catholike faith, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municator with the Apoſtolike See, by reaſon of his publike profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein he openly before all mens eyes, and before the Emperor himſelfe, profeſſed to receive all things which the Apoſtolike See did preſcribe. Thus <hi>Baronius.</hi> By whoſe words it is moſt cleare that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimus,</hi> when hee was placed in that See of Conſtantinople by the meanes of the Empreſſe, was not knowne to her, nor diſcovered to the Church, as yet, to be an heretike, nor a full yeare after: hee was held &amp; reputed by all for a Catholike, and very orthodoxall Biſhop. What fault was this now in <hi>Theodora</hi> or <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> to place him in this See, whom they knew for no other than a Catholike? who profeſſed to hold the foure former Councels, and promiſed to yeeld to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Agapetus</hi> a knowne Catholike did preſcribe. Nay, ſeeing by <hi>Baronius</hi> owne confeſſion, the Empreſſe did then favour him <hi>uti ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxo, no otherwiſe than as being orthodoxall,</hi> ſhe even therein teſtified her orthodoxy in faith at that time, as favouring him <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe ſhe thought him to be orthodoxall. So farre was ſhe in this act either from being an heretike, or deſerving thoſe epithetes &amp; titles, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Cardinall hath fetcht from hell to beſtow upon her, that in very deed by the Cardinals words ſhe deſerveth praiſe and honour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſecond point concernes the bienniall contention with <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> for reſtoring of <hi>Anthimus,</hi> which out of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Anaſt. in vita Vigil.</note>

And though for a while after the depoſition of <hi>Anthimus,</hi> ſhee, being deceived by his faire words and ſhew of piety, ſought to reſtore him: yet when ſhee ſaw <hi>Anthimus</hi> to remaine an obſtinate heretike, and to oppugne the faith of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> ſhee quite left off all ſtriving for <hi>Anthimus,</hi> and became with <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> a condemner of the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> (as <hi>Victor</hi>

So unjuſtly doth the Cardinall take occaſion upon an untruth and legendary fable to revile the Empreſſe as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The third and laſt point concernes the direfull thunderblaſt of Excommunication, which <hi>Vigilius</hi> the Romane <hi>Iupiter</hi> caſt from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

It was Pope <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus,</hi> and not <hi>Vigilius,</hi> by whom (if by any) <hi>Theodora</hi> was excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, ſeeing <hi>Theodora</hi> did contend with <hi>Agapetus</hi> about <hi>Anthimus,</hi> and that alſo before his depoſition. It was he which called <hi>Theodora, Eleutheria,</hi> a perſecuting Empreſſe. <hi>Vigilius</hi> had no occaſion at his comming to excommunicate her, the cauſe of <hi>Anthimus</hi> was before that ended. <hi>Theodora</hi> and <hi>Vigilius</hi> conſented together in one profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith: he condemning the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> a little after he came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as well as the Empreſſe, could not condemne or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate her for an heretike, but hee muſt condemne himſelfe alſo.

               <p n="3">3.

And what is this elſe, but to condemne the judgement of the fift generall Councell, of Pope <hi>Pelagius, Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and all Popes after them, of all generall Councells following it; in a word, to contradict, and utterly condemne the conſenting judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church, for the ſpace of 11. hundred yeares? they all approve the determination of the fift Councell, and it ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth with the <hi>Edict</hi> in condemning the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> that in their definitive ſentence they differ very little in words, but in ſubſtance and ſenſe nothing at all from the <hi>Emperours Edict,</hi> which cauſed <hi>Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to ſay, the Edict of the Emperour was approved by the Pope and the Councell: So Catholike and orthodoxall is it, ſo adviſedly and orthodoxally penned. To ſeeke no further proofe, <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe was ſo infatuated in this cauſe, that he oftentimes confuteth his owne ſayings: for himſelfe gives a moſt ample and moſt obſervable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this <hi>Edict,</hi> and of the orthodoxy thereof, ſaying<note n="ſ" place="margin">

               <p n="9">9. You ſee that yet it appeares not that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was the writer or penner of this Decree, none of <hi>Baronius</hi> his witneſſes affirming it, and <hi>Liberatus,</hi> who is the beſt of them all, affirming the contrary. I might now with this anſwer put off a great part of thoſe reviling ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which <hi>Baronius</hi> ſo prodigally beſtoweth on <hi>Theodorus:</hi> But I minde not ſo to leave the Cardinall, nor ſuffer the proud Philiſtine ſo inſolently to revile and inſult over any one of the Iſraelites; much leſſe this worthy Biſhop of Ceſarea, to whom hee could not have done a greater honor, than in that which he intended as an exceeding diſgrace to him, to call and account him the Author and Writer of this <hi>Edict.</hi> It is no ſmall honour, that <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> ſo wiſe and religious an Emperour, ſhould commit the care of ſo waighty a matter to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus;</hi> that hee ſhould have him in ſo high eſteeme, as account his word an Oracle, to bee guided and directed by his judgement; ſo to adhere unto him, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did to that renowned <hi>Hoſius,</hi> as to thinke it a <hi>piaculum,</hi> or great offence not to follow his advice in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſo great waight, conſequence, and importance. Nay, this one <hi>Edict,</hi> (ſuppoſing with the Cardinall <hi>Theodorus</hi> to bee the Author of it) ſhall not onely pleade for <hi>Theodorus,</hi> but utterly wipe away all thoſe vile ſlanders of hereſie, impiety, imprudency, and the like, ſo often, and ſo odiouſly objected, and exaggerated by the Cardinall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; this writing and the words thereof being (as whoſoever readeth them will eaſily conceive, and if hee deale ingenuouſly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) the words of truth, of faith, of ſobriety, of profound knowledge, evidences of a minde full fraught with faith, with piety, with the love
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7680:196"/> of God, and Gods Church, and in a word full of the holy Ghoſt. As <hi>Sophocles</hi>

               <p n="10">10. Now as this may ſerve for a generall Antidote at once, as it were, to expell all the whole poyſon of thoſe Baronian calumnies; ſo, if we ſhall deſcend to particulars, the innocency of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> as alſo the malice and malignity of <hi>Baronius</hi> will much more clearly appeare. The crimes objected to <hi>Theodorus</hi> by <hi>Baronius</hi> are reduced to three heads; one, his threefold hereſie; another, his oppoſing himſelfe to Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or the Decree of Taciturnity, in the cauſe of the <hi>Three Chapters;</hi> the third, his miſleading of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> into the hereſie of the Aphthardokites, and ſo cauſing that great perſecution of the Church which thereupon enſued; all the other diſgracefull termes are but the ſuperfluity of that malice which the Cardinall beares againſt all that were oppoſite to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Conſtitution. To begin then with that which is eaſieſt, the two laſt crimes are not ſo eaſily uttered as refuted, they both are nothing elſe but meere ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and calumnies, without any certaine ground, or probability of truth, deviſed either by <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe, or by ſuch as he is, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and haters of the truth; and truly for the later, his miſleading <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> into the hereſie of the Apthardokites, that is not onely a manifeſt untruth, (for <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> as wee have before<note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ca.</hi> 20.</note> proved, did not onely at all hold that hereſie) but it is wholly forged and deviſed by <hi>Baronius,</hi> he hath not any one Author, no not ſo much as a forged writing to teſtifie this, no nor any probable collection out of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to induce him to lay this imputation upon <hi>Theodorus;</hi> the world is wholly and ſoly beholden to the Cardinall for this ſhameleſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny; and yet ſee the wiſedome of <hi>Baronius</hi> herein, hee was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent barely and in a word to taxe and reprove <hi>Theodorus,</hi> (which had beene more than ſufficient, having no proofe nor evidence of the crime) but in this paſſage, as if hee had demonſtratively proved <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> to bee guilty hereof, hee rageth and foameth like a wilde Bore againſt him, calling him a moſt wicked man, and moſt vehement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugner of blaſphemy, the plague of the whole Church, who with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor affrayed the Emperour like a little Boy from the truth, and led him captive into hereſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="11">11. The other crime, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> oppoſed himſelfe to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and to the decree of ſilence, is like the former, ſave that this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:7680:197"/> is to be obſerved betwixt them, that the former was forged by <hi>Baronius,</hi> but this later is grounded on a fooliſh and forged wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting applauded by <hi>Baronius,</hi> fictions and forgeries they are both, but the one was fained to the Cardinals hand, for the other hee was faine to beate it out of his owne anvill.

               <p n="14">14. Here by the way I muſt in a word put the reader in minde of one or two points which concern <hi>Poſſevine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> in this paſſage. If <hi>Facundus</hi> be a condemned heretike for writing in defence of the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> what elſe can <hi>Poſſevine</hi> be who prayſed thoſe bookes of a condemned heretike? for thus he writeth<note n="c" place="margin">Loco citato.</note>, <hi>Facundus</hi> writ <hi>opus gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de atque elegans, a great and elegant worke,</hi> containing twelve books, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the authorities of the Fathers in defence of the <hi>three Chapters.</hi> Heretike! Is that a brave and elegant booke that defendeth hereſie? can hereſie be fortified by the teſtimonies of the holy Fathers? What is this elſe but to make the holy Fathers heretikes? So hereticall and ſpitefull is <hi>Poſſevine,</hi> that together with himſelfe he would draw the ancient and holy Fathers into one and the ſame crime of hereſie. The other point concernes <hi>Baronius:</hi> hee ſayth<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 547. <hi>nu.</hi> 30</note> that the controverſie or contention about the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> was <hi>inter Catholicos tantum, onely among ſuch as were Catholikes:</hi> doth not he plainly thereby ſignifie his opinion of <hi>Facundus,</hi> that he was a Catholike? for <hi>Facundus</hi> was as hot, and earneſt a contender in that controverſie as <hi>Vigilius</hi> himſelfe; he writ in defence of the <hi>three Chapters</hi> twelve whole bookes, elegant and brave bookes, as <hi>Poſſevine</hi> ſaith: he bitterly inveighed againſt the Emperour, againſt all the condemners of them, againſt Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> himſelfe, when hee after his comming to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> conſented to the Emperor. Seeing this <hi>Facundus</hi> (a convicted and condemned he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hetike) is one of the Cardinals Catholikes, muſt not hereſie and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianiſme bee with him Catholike doctrine? muſt not the impious <hi>Epiſtle</hi> be orthodoxall, and the overthrow of the faith and decree of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> bee an Article of <hi>Baronius</hi> faith? even that which he accounted the Catholike faith? But this by the way. We ſee now what manner of Biſhop <hi>Facundus</hi> was, an obſtinate heretike, pertinaciouſly perſiſting in hereſie. What though <hi>Facundus</hi> call <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> an Origeniſt? Did not the old Neſtorians call <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and other Catholikes, Apollinarians? of whom it ſeemes the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>three Chapters</hi> learned to calumniate the Catholikes with the names of heretikes and Origeniſts, when they were in truth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to thoſe and other hereſies. Can any expect a true teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> from <hi>Facundus,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Catholikes, from heretikes, their immortall and malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor theirs onely, but enemies to the truth?

               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Aronius</hi> perceiving right well, that all which heretofore hath beene ſaid either againſt the Emperour, or the Empreſſe, or the Edict, or <hi>Theodorus</hi> the ſuppoſed author of it, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in any meaſure either to defend, or excuſe <hi>Vigilius;</hi> in the next place he taketh a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth &amp; unuſuall, but a moſt ſure courſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee may not onely weaken, but utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow all that hath or can be ſaid againſt the Pope in this cauſe; for the <hi>Acts</hi> of the fift generall Councell being the moſt authentike records that can bee produced, to prove <hi>Vigilius</hi> and all that defend him, to bee heretikes; the Cardinall, and after him <hi>Binius</hi> will now no longer hacke at this or that perſon, which were agents in the cauſe, and but petty branches, but now hee will ſtrike at the very roote, calling into queſtion the Acts and evidences themſelves, ſtriving to prove them to bee of no credit; which if hee can doe, all the reſt, whatſoever can bee ſaid, will moſt eaſily bee rejected. Now becauſe <hi>Baronius</hi> was willing in this paſſage to ſhew not onely the utmoſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of his wit, but his exact diligence in picking out every quarrell, that art or malice could ſuggeſt againſt the Acts of this holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, I muſt intreate the reader not to thinke it tedious (though unto mee this was a matter almoſt of greateſt trouble and difficultie) to heare patiently, and weigh with equity of judgement the manifold exceptions againſt theſe Acts, which he hath collected, or rather ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon every occaſion which offered it ſelfe here and there, that by his inculcating, and ingeminating of the accuſation he might breed ſome opinion of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And before I enter into examination of the particulars, let me put the reader in minde of one or two conſiderations which may in generall concerne them all. The firſt is, that though the Cardinall, and <hi>Binius</hi> following him, have ſpared no labour to ſift theſe Acts as diligently as Satan did Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and have objected ten or twelve ſpeciall corruptions in them, yet not any thing which they mention, or againſt which they except, doth any way ſo touch or concerne the cauſe of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> whereof wee have intreated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as either to ſhew that the Councell condemneth them not; or that <hi>Vigilius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth them not by his definitive &amp; <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or that the Councell by their Synodall ſentence and conſenting judgement did not for that cauſe condemne, anathematize, and accurſe for heretikes all that defend them, and ſo Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> among the reſt, and al that defend him or his <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitution.</hi> All theſe are matters of ſo certaine, evident, and undoubted truth, by the Acts, that <hi>Baronius</hi> or
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7680:201"/> 
                  <hi>Binius</hi> could finde nothing at all to blemiſh or darken them. So then, though the Acts were admitted in 100. or 1000. other points to bee corrupted, mutilated, and altered, yet the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> are never a whit the nearer; the maine point at which they aime, is to excuſe <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and thoſe that defend him, but notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all that they have ſaid, (and they have ſaid all that induſtry, having borrowed ſerpentine eyes, could finde out) both <hi>Vigilius</hi> himſelfe, and all who defend him, and thoſe are all who defend the Popes <hi>infallibility in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cauſes of faith,</hi> that is, all Papiſts, remaine ſtill, as convicted, accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and anathematized heretikes, and that by the judgment of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generall Councell, approved by all ſucceeding, both Popes and Councels, till the time of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond thing which I obſerve is, that corruptions which happely may bee crept into ſome Synodall Acts, or other writings, whether by mutilations, additions, or alterations, are no juſt cauſe to reject, as unworthy of credit, all the Acts of that Councell, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the author.

Truly, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe what might move the great Card. to make ſuch a collection, and reaſon, as from ſome corruptions crept into the bookes of fathers, or Acts of Councels, to inferre, that the whole Acts or writings are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any credit, but onely as <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> had a purpoſe to burne all authentick records and writings of law, that, as hee boaſted, all the law might proceed from his own mouth; ſo the Cardinal intended to play a right <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> with all the ancient Councels and Fathers, that having utterly, though not aboliſhed, yet diſgraced, and made them all by this his reaſon and collection unworthy of any credit, his owne mouth might bee an Oracle to report without controulment all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of ancient matters; and what his Cardinalſhip ſhould pleaſe to ſay in any matter, or to ſet downe in his Annals, that all men ſhould beleeve, as if the moſt authentick Records in the world had teſtified the ſame: How much better and more adviſedly might the Cardinall have done, to have wiſhed all corruptions to bee removed? whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be certainly proved in any Acts of Councels, or writings of Fathers to be added unto them, that to be quite cut off; whatſoever might bee found wanting, that to bee added; whatſoever to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or perverted, that to be amended, and not in the blindneſſe of his hatred, againſt this one fift Councell, to fight like one of the <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batae,</hi> againſt al the reſt, and with one ſtroke to caſhire all the Acts and Canons of Councels, all the writings of Fathers or Hiſtorians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, forſooth, one or ſome few corruptions have either by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or errour of writing, or by fraud and malice of ſome malignant hand crept into them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third thing which I obſerve, is, that whereas <hi>Baronius</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſo ſpightfully declameth againſt the Acts of this Councell, as imperfect and corrupted; this his whole accuſation proceedeth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7680:202"/> to the Councell and theſe Acts, rather than of judgement or of truth; for I doe conſtantly affirme, and who ſo ever pleaſeth to peruſe the Councels ſhall certainly finde, (and, if he deale ingenuouſly, will confeſſe the ſame) that as of al the general Councels which go before this fift, for integrity of the Acts, none is better, or any way compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this, ſave that of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> ſo of all that follow it none at all is to bee preferred, nor any way to bee counted equall with it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that which they call the ſixt Councell, that is, ſo much of the Acts of that Synod as concerne the cauſe of the Monothelites, leaving out the <hi>Trullane</hi> Canons: This, whoſoever is exerciſed in the Volumes of Councels cannot chooſe but obſerve. The Nicene &amp; Conſtantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane being ſo miſerably maimed, that ſcarce wee have ſo much as a few ſhreds or chips of the moſt magnificent buildings of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, which, if they could bee recovered, no treaſures are ſufficient to redeeme a worke of that worth and value, a worke <hi>non gemmis, neque purpura vaenale, neque auro.</hi> That of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is a little helped indeed by <hi>Peltanus,</hi> but yet it remaines ſo imperfect, ſo confuſed, and diſorderly, that as <hi>Diogines</hi> ſought men in the moſt thronged multitudes of men, ſo among thoſe very Acts &amp; large Tomes of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, the reader ſhall be forced to ſeeke the Acts of the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Councell. The Acts of the ſecond <hi>Nicene,</hi> and of the next to it, which they call the eighth, are ſo doubtfull, that not onely this or that part, but the whole fabrick of them both is queſtionable, whether they were the Synodall Acts, or but a relation framed by <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> as hee thought beſt. Of all the eight Councels, the Acts of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> this fift, and the ſixt have beene moſt ſafely preſerved, and like the river <hi>Arethuſa</hi> have ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed through ſo many corrupt ages and hands, and yet without tainture of the ſalt, deliver unto us the cleare and ſweete current of antiquity and truth: And verily, when I ſeriouſly compare the wrack of other Councels with the entireneſſe of theſe three, I cannot but admire and magnifie with all my might the gracious providence, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and love of God to his Church, for in every one of theſe there is an unreſiſtable force of truth, againſt that Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authority &amp; ſupremacy which is now made the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Popiſh faith; the ſixt in the cauſe of <hi>Honorius,</hi> the fift in this cauſe of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in curbing the Popes Legates, in croſſing the decree, and knowne reſolution of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and in being a moſt lively patterne of that rightfull and ancient authority which Emperours then held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Biſhops in the Councell; but now the Pope uſurpes both above all Biſhops, Emperours and Councels. God would by theſe monuments of antiquity pull downe the lofty Towers, and raze from the very bottome that foundation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> can never be firme and ſetled; hee would have, beſides other particular witneſſes, theſe unconquerable and irreſiſtible forces of theſe ancient and generall Councels, againſt which no juſt exception can be taken: and although I will not excuſe the acts of theſe, nor any of them from all defects and blemiſhes whatſoever, yet I dare boldly averre, that they are ſo few, ſo light, and of ſo ſmall importance, that the maine controverſies handled in them, or relying on them, cannot be prejudicated thereby,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7680:202"/> they being rather the errours of the Collectors, or of the writers, and exſcribers of theſe Councels, than of the Councels themſelves: And particularly for this fift Councell, againſt which <hi>Baronius</hi> doth ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly declame: I doubt not to make it evident, that all the faults, which, after much prying, hee hath objected unto the Acts thereof, will prove ſo many evident teſtimonies of his owne moſt fraudulent and corrupt dealing, and not the defects or corruptions in the Acts of this Councell. But let us view the particulars.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, whereas hee ſaith, that the Scythian Monkes would <hi>inferre verba iſta in Synodum Chalcedonenſem,</hi> bring or thruſt in thoſe words into the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it is a ſlander without all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or ground of truth: they ſaw divers Neſtorians obſtinate in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this truth, that Chriſt was <hi>unus de ſancta Trinitate,</hi> who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them that theſe words were not expreſſed in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> the Monkes and Catholikes moſt juſtly replyed, that though the expreſſe words were not there, yet the ſenſe of them was decreed in that Councell, that this confeſſion was but an expreſſion or explication of that which was truly, implicitely, and more obſcurely decreed at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> To falſifie the Acts of that Councell, or adde one ſyllable unto it, otherwiſe than by way of explanation or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, the Monks and Catholikes, whom <hi>Baronius</hi> calleth Eutyche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, never ſought to doe, as at large appeares by that moſt learned and orthodoxall booke written by <hi>Iohannes Maxentius</hi> about this very cauſe, againſt which booke, and the Author thereof, the more earneſtly <hi>Baronius</hi> doth oppoſe himſelfe, and call them hereticall, hee doth not therby one whit diſgrace them (his tongue and pen is no ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at leaſt not to weighed) but the more he ſtill intangles himſelfe in the hereſie of the Neſtorians, out of which in that cauſe none can extricate him, as in another Treatiſe I purpoſe God willing, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly, whereas <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, that the Scythian Monkes prevailed not in the dayes of <hi>Hormiſda, quod abſque additamento Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus rectè conſiſteret,</hi> becauſe the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was well enough without that addition, hee ſhewes a notable ſleight of his hereticall fraud. That the Synod is well enough without adding thoſe words, as an expreſſe part of the Synodall decree, or as written <hi>totidem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> by the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> is moſt true, but nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for neither the Scythian Monks nor any Catholikes did affirme them ſo to bee, or wiſh them ſo to bee added, for that had beene to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7680:204"/> ſay in expreſſe words, wee will have the decree falſified, or written in other words than it was by the Councell: But that the Synod was well enough without this additament, as an explication of it, and declaration of the ſenſe of that Councell, is moſt untrue; for both <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> by his Edict commanded, and Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> by his <hi>Apoſtolike</hi> authoritie confirmed, that to bee the true meaning, both of that Councell, and of all the holy Fathers: And when a controverſie is once moved, and on foote, whether Chriſt ought to bee called <hi>unus de ſancta Trinitate,</hi> for a man then to deny this, or deny it to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> or to deny that it ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a true explanation of that Councell, is to deny the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, and the decrees of the foure firſt Councels; and though one ſhall ſay and profeſſe in words, as did <hi>Hormiſda</hi> and his Legates, that they hold the whole Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> yet in that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deny this truth, which was certainly decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> their generall profeſſion ſhall not excuſe them, but their expreſſe deniall of this one particular ſhall demonſtrate them, both to bee heretikes, and expreſly to beleeve and hold an hereſie repugnant to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, which in a generality they profeſſe to hold, but indeed and truth doe not. Even as the expreſſe denying of the manhood, or Godhead of Chriſt, or reſurrection of the dead ſhall convince one to bee an heretike, though hee profeſſe himſelfe in a generality to beleeve and hold all that the holy Scriptures doe teach, or the Nicene fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. If <hi>Baronius</hi> his words, that the Councell is right without that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament, bee taken in the former ſenſe, they are idle, vaine, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to no purpoſe, which, of the Cardinals deepe wiſedome is not to bee imagined: If they bee taken (as I ſuppoſe they are) in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, they undeniably demonſtrate him to bee a Cardinall Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But leaving all the reſt of the Cardinals frauds in this paſſage, let us come to that laſt clauſe which concernes the corrupting of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> This, ſaith he, which in <hi>Hormiſdaes</hi> dayes they could not, now in this fift Synod they obtained, now they added to the words of the Synod this clauſe, <hi>qui eſt Dominus unus de ſancta Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate:</hi> A very perilous corruption ſure, to expreſſe that clauſe which all the Biſhops of <hi>Rome, (ſemper excipio Hormiſdam)</hi> with all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, beleeved and taught, which, whoſoever denieth or wil not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, is anathematized, and excluded from the Catholike Church. Is not this thinke you a very ſore corruption of the Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi> Is not the Cardinall a rare man of judgement that could ſpie ſuch a maine fault in theſe Acts of the fift Councell, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt to be <hi>unum de ſancta Trinitate;</hi> to which profeſſion both they and all other were bound under the cenſure of an anathema.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea, but in the Acts thoſe words are cited as the words of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> whoſe they are not. A meere fancy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of the Cardinall: they are plainly ſet downe as the words of the fift Synod, whoſe indeed they are; and it relateth not preciſely the words of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> nor what it there expreſſed, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> but the true ſumme and ſubſtance of what is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7680:204"/> For thus they ſay<note n="i" place="margin">Coll. <hi>6.</hi> pa. <hi>575.</hi> a.</note>, <hi>The holy Synod of Chalcedon in the definition which it made of faith, doth profeſſe God the Word incarnate, to be made man;</hi> this is all they report of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as by the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ibas</hi> his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is apparent, wherein they oppoſe not that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Chriſt to be one of the Trinity, but that hee called them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes who taught the Word incarnate to be made man. That clauſe which they adde [That Chriſt is one of the Trinity] is an addition of the fift Councell it ſelfe, explicating that of Chriſt, which the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Edict</hi> bound them to profeſſe, as being the true ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> but not as being word for word ſet downe in the decree of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> And even as he were more than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, who would accuſe one to corrupt the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for ſaying they profeſſed Chriſt to be God and man, who was borne in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and fled from <hi>Herod</hi> into Aegypt; ſo is the Cardinall as ridiculous in objecting this as a corruption of the Synod, or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that they ſay the Councell taught the Word of God to bee man, who is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, one of the holy Trinity. Both additions are true, but neither of them affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be expreſly, and <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> ſet downe in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Why but looke to the Cardinals proofe; for he would not for any good affirme ſuch a matter without proofe. What? doe yee aske for proofe of the Cardinall? I tell you, it is proofe enough that he ſayth it: and truly in this poynt he produceth neither any proofe, nor any ſhadow of reaſon to prove either that thoſe words are falſely inſerted into the Acts of the fift Councell, or that the fift Councell cited them as the very expreſſe words of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> all the proofe is grounded on his old Topicke place <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> which is a ſory kind of arguing, againſt any that love the truth: for although againſt the Pope or their popiſh cauſe, any thing which he writeth is a very ſtrong evidence againſt them, ſeeing the Cardinall is very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect &amp; wary to let nothing, no not a ſyllable fall from him which may in the leaſt wiſe ſeem to prejudice the Popes dignity, or the cauſe of their Church, unleſſe the maine force and undeniable evidence of truth doe wreſt and wring it from his pen: yet in any matter of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein he may advantage the Pope, or benefit their cauſe, it is not by many degrees ſo good to ſay, the <hi>illuſtriſsimus Cardinalis</hi> affirmes it, which is now growne a familiar kinde of proofe among them<note n="k" place="margin">Vide Gretz. tractatus varios, &amp; alios ejus farinae.</note>, as to ſay, <hi>Ovid, Aeſop,</hi> or <hi>Iacobus Voraginenſis</hi> affirme it, therefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true.

                  </note> day of their Collation. The whole cauſe being thus, and, as the Councell confeſſeth, moſt diligently and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently examined, the Councell (as it ſeemeth by their owne words in the end of the ſixt Collation) intended to proceed to ſentence in the next day of their meeting: but before ought was done therein, the Emperour ſent unto the Synod certaine letters of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> teſtifying his condemning of thoſe <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and ſome other writings, the reading of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is all was done in the ſeventh<note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>7.</hi> Coll. <hi>26.</hi> die Maij.</note> day of their Collation. Now for that the cauſe was ſufficiently examined before, and theſe letters were read onely for a further evidence, but not for neceſſity of the cauſe, and for that the Synod did nothing themſelves, but onely heard the letters, and applauded the Emperours zeale and care for the truth, therefore it is that this ſeventh Collation, and what was
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7680:209"/> done therein is omitted in the Synodall ſentence, and the Councell which on that ſeventh day had made ready and intended to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their ſentence, by this occaſion deferred it to the next, which was the eighth<note n="y" place="margin">

Thus not onely by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and the Emperours <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> but by the evident teſtimony of the whole Synod in the ſynodall ſentence, it is undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly certaine that the cauſe of <hi>Origen</hi> was not as he fancieth the firſt action or cauſe handled in the Synod, and that he doth but play the Mome in carping at the Acts for want of the firſt Action.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may bee yet that the cauſe of <hi>Origen</hi> was the ſecond action in the fift Synod, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi>

No, it was not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond neither; as it was not before, ſo neither was it handled after the other of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> witneſſe the Synodall ſentence it ſelfe, wherein all the matters which every day they examined and diſcuſſed are ſet downe and repeated; after repetition they teſtifie<note n="a" place="margin">Coll. <hi>8.</hi> p. <hi>586.</hi> a</note> alſo, <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titis igitur omnibus, quae apud nos acta ſunt, all things being repeated which were done or handled by way of diſcuſsion among us,</hi> or in this Synod.

When they had already condemned both him and his errors, what an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity is it to make the Emperour demand, what they would decree of him and his errours? Or may we thinke that the holy Synod would firſt condemne <hi>Origen,</hi> and his impious writings as they did, in the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall ſentence againſt the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> and then afterwards examin the matter, and make an enquiry whether <hi>Origen</hi> and his writings were to bee condemned or not? which were to follow that diſorder which the Switzers are reported to have uſed in judgement, (which was moſt juſtly called <hi>Iudicium vetitum</hi>) to execute a man, and then try and examine whether he ought to be executed or not. Farre be it from any to imagine ſuch injuſtice and raſhneſſe to have beene in this holy generall Councell. Seeing then they condemned and accurſed <hi>Origen</hi> and all his errours, in that which <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Evagrius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the former Seſſion, it is ridiculous to think that either the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7680:209"/> urged, or that they themſelves would in the ſecond Seſſion goe Switzer-like to examine the bookes and doctrines of <hi>Origen,</hi> whether he &amp; they ought to be condemned.

They might as well call into queſtion whether <hi>Arius,</hi> or <hi>Macedonius,</hi> or <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> or <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and their doctrine ſhould bee condemned: the judgement of the Catholike Church was alike paſſed on them all: for this Councell<note n="g" place="margin">

And this verily ſeemes to have deceived and led into error <hi>Evagrius, Nicephorus,</hi> and <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> (for of <hi>Baronius</hi> I cannot for many reaſons imagine it to have beene errour or ignorance in him, but wilfull and malicious oppugning the truth,) they knew or heard by report, (for even <hi>Evagrius</hi>

Yet theſe men have not very well ſummed up their accounts. For how did <hi>Theodorus</hi> take away that which was againſt the Origeniſts, whereas hee ſuffered to ſtay in the Acts an anathema to <hi>Origen,</hi> and to the impious writings of <hi>Origen,</hi> and to all that thinke as did <hi>Origen,</hi> yea to all that doe not anathematize <hi>Origen?</hi> What ſillineſſe was it in the Cardinall, to think that <hi>Theodorus</hi> or any Origeniſt would ſpoyle the Acts, and take away ſome diſcourſes, and diſputations againſt <hi>Origen,</hi> and leave that which is the maine matter of all, the ſentence of condemnation againſt him, and his errors, yea againſt themſelves, (ſuppoſing them to be ſuch as the Cardinall ſlandereth them) and that alſo ſubſcribed by their owne hands, as an eternall witneſſe againſt them? So maliciouſly blinded were the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> in this cauſe, that ſo they ſpake againſt the Councell and the Catholike Biſhops thereof, they regard not how untruly, how unadviſedly they ſlander them. But neither is it a diſgrace to <hi>Theodorus</hi> to ſuffer like ſlander as did <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> nor is it any honour to the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> to ſlander, and doe the like as their forefathers the old Arians have done before them.

The Emperour, and ſo all the Biſhops of the Synod laboured, as much as they could, to draw the whole Church to unity of faith with themſelves, eſpecially Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> whoſe conſent might happily draw after it, if not the whole; yet a great part of the Weſterne Church, which were moſt earneſt in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> They knew that in particular, and by name to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or his <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> might not only have exaſperated, but even utterly alienated the minde of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and made him (and with him his adherents) more obſtinate in their hereſie. They ſought by ſilence to conceale and by charity to ſuppreſſe, as much as they could, that hereticall and diſgracefull <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of his, and by their
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7680:212"/> lenity and faire meanes, to gaine him, and his conſent to them, yea, even to the truth it ſelfe: for this cauſe, though they knew full well, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had ſet out that decree, yea, though they confuted all the ſubſtance thereof, and condemned both it, and him in generalities, yet they forbare at all to name <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or in particular to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion this his decree; that had beene to proclame hoſtility, and have made an abſolute breach betwixt them and <hi>Vigilius</hi> for ever.</p>

Beſides this, which was a very juſt reaſon, not ſo much as to publiſh (as they did not) that <hi>Conſtitution</hi> in their Synod, the Emperour had alwayes a purpoſe to have (as in the ſeventh Collation was done) the Epiſtles of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to <hi>Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtianus</hi> to <hi>Valentinianus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly read &amp; publiſhed in the Councel: In them <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authority decreeth the condemning of the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> what a diſgrace had this beene to <hi>Vigilius</hi> to publiſh firſt his <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Conſtitution</hi> in defence, and ſhortly after, his <hi>Apoſtolicall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> for condemning the ſame <hi>Three Chapters?</hi> How juſtly might this have incenſed <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and for ever with-held him from conſenting to them, who had proclamed him in their Councell, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded him in their Synodall Acts to bee ſuch a <hi>Proteus?</hi> Nay, this had extenuated and vilified for ever the authority of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> &amp; the holy <hi>Apoſtolike</hi> See, to record two conſtitutions, both procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>ex Tripode,</hi> fighting <hi>ex Diametro,</hi> and by an unreconciliable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction oppoſed the one to the other. Seeing then both the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the Councell meant by their ſo often expreſſing the conſent of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to them, and by their reciting his <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitution</hi> for condemning the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> in the ſeventh Collation, ſeeing they meant hereby to draw others to the like conſent to the truth, by the authority and credit of the Pope and his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> decree: it is not to bee imagined that the Emperour of Councell would at all, either publiſh in their Synod, or inſert among their Acts the contrary <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters;</hi> in doing whereof they ſhould not onely have for ever diſgraced <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but have much impaired the reputation of their owne wiſedome, and quite croſſed their principall deſigne: Nay, what will you ſay if <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe profeſſe the ſame?

Truly I doe verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe, conſidering both that the ſixt Councell was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vigilant to preſerve the true Acts; and alſo that theſe which now we have, are ſo exact, as before I have declared, that theſe are no other than the copies of thoſe ſelfe ſame ancient and incorrupted acts (ſave ſome few and light faults, which by the writers thereof have happened) which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> had, and in that ſixt Councell were read, and commended to all poſterity. And I doubt not but the fraud of heretikes being then ſo fully and openly diſcovered, the Church ever ſince hath moſt diligently and curiouſly, not onely carefully, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame. Which may well be thought to bee the true cauſe, why of all the eight Councels the Acts of theſe three laſt, that at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> this fift, and the other of the ſixt, are come moſt ſafe and intire unto our hands. Howſoever, certaine it is that the Cardinall and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> doe moſt childiſhly ſophiſticate, in accuſing the copies of the Acts now extant, (which onely we defend) to be corrupted, becauſe thoſe three or moe copies of the Acts which were produced in the ſixt Synod, (which we deteſt and condemne much more than the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall) were falſified by the Monothelites, none of thoſe falſe additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being found in theſe.</p>

The law in the <hi>Code</hi> and theſe in the Acts are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent lawes: True, they are ſo: but can the Cardinall prove, or doth he once offer to prove that they are one law? and that they ought not to differ? No: the Cardinall was wiſe enough not to undertake ſo hard a taske. For it is as evident as the Sun, that the law againſt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius</hi> which is in the <hi>Code</hi> was one, and firſt publiſhed; and long after that theſe which are recited in the Acts. In the one of theſe it is ſaid<note n="u" place="margin">Pa. <hi>544.</hi> b.</note>, <hi>Iterum, igitur doctrina Diodori, &amp; Theodori, &amp; Neſtorij viſa eſt nobis abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minanda, It ſeemes good to us againe to deteſt the doctrine of Diodorus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, and Neſtorius.</hi> This <hi>Iterum,</hi> imports it was once done before in a former law, and now in this the Emperour would doe the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. As the lawes, ſo the occaſion of them, was quite different. That in the <hi>Code</hi> was made indeed againſt the hereſies of the Neſtorians, but in it none of them were perſonally &amp; by name condemned, but only <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,</hi> all the reſt who favoured that hereſie, were in a generality, not by name condemned; becauſe when that law was made, the Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans honoured, and held <hi>Neſtorius</hi> for their chiefeſt patron, and urged his writings: In theſe two recited in the Acts, <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Tarſis, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſveſtia,</hi> and their writings, are particularly, and by name condemned, as well as <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> and in the later the writings alſo of <hi>Theodoret</hi> againſt <hi>Cyrill:</hi> for when after that firſt law ſet downe in the <hi>Code,</hi> the Neſtorians durſt not, nor could without danger of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either praiſe <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> or reade, write, or urge his books, which were all by that law condemned: then they began to magnifie <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſveſtia,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and the writing of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> all which were as plaine and plentifull for their hereſie, as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but becauſe theſe were not as yet by name condemned, nor by name prohibited, they preſumed more boldly to rely on them. The Catholikes, and ſpecially they of Armenia, as is witneſſed<note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coll.</hi> 5. <hi>pa.</hi> 542</note> in a letter from them to <hi>Proclus,</hi> ſeeing this their new device, entreated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to ſtop that wicked courſe, &amp; to condemne by name <hi>Theodorus,</hi> as well as hee had done <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> Which though at the firſt the Emperour did not, yet ſeeing how inſolent the Neſtorians grew upon thoſe writings, long after the former, he publiſhed theſe two, condemning now <hi>explicitè</hi> by name, and in particular, <hi>Diodorus, Theodorus,</hi> and the writing of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which before were onely <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitè,</hi> and in a generality condemned. When the lawes, the occaſion, the time of promulgation, were all different, was not the Cardinall, thinke you, bereft of judgement, who would prove theſe later to bee

And omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting infinite like proofes of the falſhood of that Epiſtle, the next yeare after the Epheſine Councell, there was a Synod<note n="e" place="margin">Tom. <hi>5.</hi> Act.

What a moſt vile and ſhameleſs untruth then is it, which the Impoſtor makes <hi>Theodoret</hi> to utter, that in the whole ſpace of 25. or 26. yeares he neither accuſed any, nor was accuſed nor reproved, no not lightly reproved either by <hi>Iohn</hi> or any other, but that all and every one of his writings, contained the true doctrine of the Church? But enough of thoſe Epiſtles, which to be forged and falſe this which is already ſayd may for this time ſuffice.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Having now declared how untrue that is which <hi>Baronius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> after the <hi>union</hi> did never embrace the hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and withall ſeene how weake and unſound his proofe is in this point, I will yet adde one conſideration which will further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and even demonſtrate the ſame. That is taken from the hiſtory of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> Certaine it is, that when <hi>Theodoret</hi> writ that hiſtory, he was earneſtly addicted to Neſtorianiſme, whereof in the very laſt Chapter<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ca.</hi> 40.</note> he gives an eminent proofe, commending <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mopſveſtia</hi> for a worthy teacher of the whole Church, and for an oppugner of all hereſies: adding, that whereas he was a Biſhop thirty ſix yeares, he never ceaſed, <hi>optimam herbam ſanctis Chriſti ovibus ſuppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditare, to feed the flocke of Chriſt with the beſt herbes.</hi> None can doubt but hee who ſo much extolleth ſo deteſtable an heretike, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thoſe moſt damnable hereſies which from him <hi>Neſtorius</hi> ſuckt, for the beſt herbes or doctrines, but he muſt needs be confeſſed to bee as deepe in Neſtorianiſme as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> himſelfe. If now it may appeare that this hiſtory was writ by him after the union, there can no doubt remaine but that after the union <hi>Theodoret</hi> favoured <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and all his hereſies.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Baronius</hi> knowing this inevitably to follow, to decline the whole force of this, tels<note n="g" place="margin">

Now ſeeing the union betweene <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> was made in the yeare 432. it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydably followeth, that either <hi>Theodoret</hi> writ not his Hiſtory till ſeven yeares at leaſt after the union, and how much more I know not, whether 8. 10. or 16. after it, (for it is uncertaine:) or if hee writ it, as the Cardinall divineth, before the Epheſine Synod, that he writ it prophetically, writing thoſe Acts which happened not till eight or nine yeares after his hiſtory was written. The truth is, an orderly and hiſtoricall continuation of things done, he doth not write, but onely to the death of <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mopſveſtia,</hi> where his hiſtory (for any ſuch continuation of ſucceeding matters) doth end: but to ſhew and teſtifie that he writ his hiſtory after the yeare 438. hee purpoſely mentioneth ſome of thoſe acts which fell out in that yeare: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of further there may be a preſumption, becauſe <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> tels<note n="m" place="margin">Ecquid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſi quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerat Sozome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, à Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repetitum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniatur.

Conſulſhip of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> as himſelfe witneſſeth: So that if <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall tels us, tooke it out of <hi>Sózomen,</hi> and his booke was not publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the yeare 439. ſure the Cardinall of all men had reaſon to think that <hi>Theodoret</hi> could not before that time (otherwiſe than propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in this point) write his hiſtory. It remaineth now, ſeeing <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> was an earneſt defender of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> at the time when he writ this hiſtory, and it was written after the yeare 438. that out of all doubt till then hee remained hereticall, and devoted to all the blaſphemies and hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Theodorus,</hi> which in that hiſtory he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for moſt wholſome food, and Catholike doctrine.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But not to ſtay longer in a matter very cleare, my concluſion of this former point is this; Seeing the Cardinall tels us that from the time of the union <hi>Theodoret</hi> was not onely a Catholike and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall Biſhop, but that he did manfully fight for the Catholike faith, it evidently followeth, that in the Cardinals judgment, Neſtorianiſm and thoſe herbes, nay moſt poyſonfull weeds of <hi>Theodorus</hi> are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrines, ſeeing as now we have proved for many (but of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for ſeven yeares at leaſt) after the <hi>union,</hi> that doctrine which <hi>Theodoret</hi> embraced, and ſo earneſtly defended, was no other than the

And becauſe the fift Councell was aſſembled for diſcuſſing that truth which the Emperor in his Edict had delivered, and <hi>Vigilius</hi> with the other Neſtorians did oppugne, the Cardinal againe might have denyed that ever there had beene any ſuch fift Councell, or any Synodall Acts at all of it; for if there was no Edict there could bee no Councel, which was aſſembled and gathered for that onely cauſe, to define the truth delivered by the Edict.

But let the Cardinall and his friends looke to this matter by what meanes or whoſe fraud this was inſerted, I thought needfull to admoniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fault, nor for the love and affection I beare to that Conſtitution of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> could I with ſilence ſee and ſuffer it to be blemiſhed therewith.</p>

Certainly <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was ignorant of this Action, and ſo was the fift Councell. And no marvell, when the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it ſelfe was ignorant thereof. And whether the Emperour and the whole fift generall Councell, wherein were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent foure Patriarkes, and the Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> alſo, whether theſe living about an hundred yeares after that Councell, bee not like to have had more true Copies of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> than <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> living eleven hundred yeares after it, it is not hard to judge.</p>

For it is certaine, (as before wee have by many reaſons proved) and by the teſtimony of the whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell<note n="t" place="margin">Iuſtinianus omnia ſemper fecit, &amp; facit, quae ſanctam Eccleſiam &amp; recta dogmata conſervant.

But let us admit that hee had indeed recalled that Edict; when thinke you was this done? No man can tell you better than <hi>Baronius,</hi> who referres all that to the 26. yeare of <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> which is the 17. of the Gothicke warre; for by his narration<note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 55. <hi>nu.</hi> 15. 22, 23.</note>, not onely the Emperour in that yeare revoked his <hi>Edict</hi> againſt the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> but he with <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and <hi>Mennas,</hi> were all in that yeare reconciled to the Pope, and a perfect peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on all hands before the moneth of Iuly; peace being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Mennas</hi> ſhortly after dyed.

                  <note n="x" place="margin">Proc. lib. <hi>3.</hi> pa. <hi>408.</hi>
                  </note> ſheweth, came not as chiefe Generall into <hi>Italy,</hi> untill the 18. yeare of the Gothicke warre, which is the 27. of <hi>Iuſtinian.</hi> Againe, ſeeing it followeth in <hi>Anaſtaſius, Tunc adunatus,</hi> then when <hi>Totilas</hi> was vanquiſhed and killed, did the Romane Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie entreat to have <hi>Vigilius</hi> with the reſt reſtored from exile. It hence clearly followeth, that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> can meane no other exile, than ſuch as was inflicted upon him ſome three or foure yeares before, for the cauſe of <hi>Anthimus,</hi> and not that which followed the Councell: for the Councell was not held in the ſeventeenth yeare of the Gothicke warre, or ſix and twentieth of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> but in the eighteenth of the one, and ſeven and twentieth of the other, as the Acts doe witneſſe:
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7680:241"/> or if <hi>Baronius</hi> will needs have the exile following the Councell, to be that from which <hi>Narſes</hi> entreated that he might be delivered; then it certainly followeth upon this account of <hi>Binius,</hi> reckoning <hi>Totilas</hi> death to be in the ſix and twentieth of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> that <hi>Narſes</hi> and the Romane Clergy entreated the Emperour to reſtore <hi>Vigilius</hi> out of exile, before he was caſt into exile; nay before the Councell was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, or before <hi>Vigilius</hi> had given any cauſe why he ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; which doth not well accord with the wiſedome of <hi>Narſes</hi> and the Romane Clergy to entreat, nor was it poſſible for the Emperour to grant. The ſame is further manifeſt by the other note of time which <hi>Binius</hi>

Secondly, that <hi>Evag.</hi> mentioneth not either invocation, or adoration, uſed by <hi>Narſes</hi> to the Virgin, or any confidence that hee repoſed in her, or that ſhe at al helped him in the battle, but only that ſhe appeared unto him as a meſſenger, to ſignifie what time he ſhould ſight. Now as the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was no helper to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception of Chriſt, or in his birth, though, as a meſſenger from God, hee ſignifieth them both unto <hi>Ioſeph, (Ioſeph</hi> neither invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating him nor relying on him, but on God, whoſe meſſenger he was) even ſo, admitting the truth of this apparition, the Vigin <hi>Mary</hi> did ſignifie from God the time when <hi>Narſes</hi> ſhould fight, but neither did <hi>Narſes</hi> invocate or adore her, nor did ſhee her ſelfe more helpe in the battle than the Angell in the birth of Chriſt; nor did the confidence of <hi>Narſes</hi> relie on her, but on God, whoſe meſſenger he then beleeved her to be. Let the Cardinall, or <hi>Binius,</hi> or any of them prove forcibly (which they can never doe) out of <hi>Evagrius</hi> any other invocation or adoration uſed by <hi>Narſes</hi> to the bleſſed Virgin, and I will conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in that whole point. Thirdly, all that <hi>Evagrius</hi> ſaith of that apparition of the bleſſed Virgin, is but a rumour and report of ſome who were with <hi>Narſes:</hi>

Now for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall to avouch a doctrine of faith out of a rumour or report of how credible men themſelves knew not, from ſuch an uncertainty to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that Generals ought to relie on the aide of the bleſſed Virgin in their battels, and that ſhee, <hi>interpellata precibus, being invocated by their prayers,</hi> riſeth up, and becomes a warrier on their ſide; this, by none that are indifferent can be judged leſſe than exceeding temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7680:242"/> and by thoſe that are religious will bee condemned as plaine ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and impiety. But let us returne now to <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> whoſe narration, as it is untrue in it ſelfe, if the comming of <hi>Narſes</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and victory over the <hi>Gothes,</hi> bee referred to that time, when <hi>Totilas</hi> had before wonne <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo it is much more untrue, if it bee referred, as by <hi>Binius</hi> gloſſe it is, either to the yeare wherein the Emperour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his Edict, (which was never) or to the tenth yeare of <hi>Totilas,</hi> which was wholly ended before the comming of <hi>Narſes</hi> into <hi>Italie,</hi> and before the fift Councell, and the Baronian baniſhment of <hi>Vigilius.</hi>

If the Emperor were hereticall and the Pope orthodoxal, there was trial of the Popes art &amp; skil in converting ſuch a man to the truth; triall of his conſtancy and love unto Gods truth, whether by feare or favour he would forſake it: triall of his patience and fortitude in induring all torments, even death it ſelfe, for his love to Chriſt. All the hurt which ſuch an Emperour did, or could doe, was to crowne him a glorious Martyr, and in ſtead of the white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of innocency, to ſend him in ſcarlet robes unto heaven; and woe be to that Church which ſhall thinke Martyrdome an hurt unto it, which was, and ever will bee the glory of the Catholike Church. <hi>Non decet ſub ſpinoſo capite membrum eſſe delicatum,</hi> when Chriſt, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and glorious Saints, and Martyrs, have gone before upon thornes and briars, wee muſt not looke to have a ſilken way, ſtrewed with Roſes and Lillies, unto the Kingdome of God. This, which is yet the very worſt that can befall any Catholike,<note place="margin">Reu. 14.13.</note> is no harme to him who hath learned that leſſon, <hi>Bleſſed are they which die in the Lord;</hi> ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pope and Emperour be both of one, or of a different religion, his preſence with the Emperour may happen to doe good, but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it can never poſſibly doe hurt unto the Church. The greateſt hurt that was ever done to the Church by this meanes, was when <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> after his baptiſme by Pope <hi>Silveſter,</hi> in liew of his paines, and in token of a thankful minde, ſealed unto him that donation<note n="k" place="margin">Donationis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar extat Diſt. <hi>96.</hi> ca.

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:7680:245"/> them ſwell to demonſtrations: But if they make againſt the Pope, as did the event in <hi>Vigilius,</hi> all arguments in the world drawne from the cauſe, effect, or any other Topicall or demonſtrative place, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall with a contrary breath can turne them al to Sophiſtications.

               <p n="6">6. And yet what are thoſe ill events and dangers whereunto the Church was brought by the comming of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> what hurt received it by the preſence of the Pope with <hi>Iuſtinian?</hi> Sure the Cardinall in good diſcretion ſhould have expreſſed them, at leaſt ſome one of them, but hee was too politike to open ſuch ſecrets of their State; for mine owne part I cannot but firſt condemne his foule ingratitude in this point. <hi>Vigilius</hi> before hee came to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> was earneſt in oppugning the truth, and Catholike faith, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> hee defended them by words, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, by cenſures, by the utmoſt of his power: All the hurt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did him was this, that he converted him to the truth, that hee brought him to define, by an <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitution,</hi> that truth which before hee oppugned, and in this tune the Emperour kept him for five or ſixe yeares together, but then when his old fit of hereſie came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him againe, when at the time of the generall Councell he forſook the Emperours holy faith, his communion, and, as may bee thought, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his company and preſence alſo, by this abſence from the Emperor, he relapſed quite from the Catholike faith, even from that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had defended and defined, ſo long as hee kept ſociety with the Emperour. When the Emperours preſence made hereticall Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> for the ſpace of five or ſixe yeares a Catholike Pope, (at leaſt in ſhew and profeſſion) doe you not thinke <hi>Baronius</hi> to deale unkindly with the Emperour in blaming the time that ever <hi>Vigilius</hi> came to the Emperour, that is in effect to blame, and little leſſe than curſe the day wherein <hi>Vigilius</hi> renounced hereſie, and embraced or made profeſſion of the Catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now as this good redownded to <hi>Vigilius</hi> in particular by his comming to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſo there is another and publike benefit which enſued thence to the whole Church, and that ſo great and ſo happy, that if we ſhould (as the Cardinall doth) meaſure things by the event, the comming of <hi>Agapetus</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though they glory therein more than in any other example of antiquity, is no way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> for by this comming of <hi>Vigilius</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by evident experience, that the Pope may ſay and gainſay his owne ſayings in matters of faith, and then define <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> both his ſayings, that is, two direct contradictories to be both true, ſeeing Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> firſt, while hee temporized with the Emperour defined <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to bee condemned, and after that, when it pleaſed him to open the depth of his owne heart, defined the quite contrary <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to bee defended. By it was further demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Pope may not onely be an heretike, but teach alſo and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:7680:245"/> and that <hi>ex cathedra,</hi> an hereſie to be truth, and ſo be a convicted, condemned, and anathematized heretike, by the judgment of an holy generall Councell, and of the whole Catholike Church. Theſe and ſome other like concluſions of great moment for the inſtruction of the whole Church of God, are ſo fully, ſo clearly, ſo undenyably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in the cauſe of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> when he came to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> that had the Cardinall or his favourers (I meane the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Popes infallibility,) grace to make uſe thereof for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their eyes in that maine and fundamentall point, wherein they are now ſo miſerably blinded, they might have greater cauſe to thank God for his comming thither, than for the voyage of <hi>Agapetus,</hi> or of any other of his predeceſſors undertaken in many yeares before.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Where are now the great hurts and inconveniences which the Cardinall fancieth by <hi>Vigilius</hi> his comming to the Emperour? Truly I cannot deviſe, what one they can finde, but the diſgrace onely of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> in that upon his comming he ſhewed himſelfe to be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizer, a very weather-cocke in faith, a diſſembler with God and his Church, pretending for five or ſix yeares that hee favoured the truth, when all that time he harboured in his breſt the deadly poyſon of that hereſie, which as before his comming he defended, ſo at the time of the Councell he defined. This blot or blemiſh of their holy Father, neither I, nor themſelves, with all the water in Tiber, can waſh or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wipe away. The beſt uſe that can be made of it, is, that as <hi>Thomas</hi> diſtruſted, to make others faithfull and void of diſtruſt; ſo God, in the infiniteneſſe of his wiſedome, permitted Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> to be not only unconſtant, but hereticall in defining cauſes of faith, that others by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the Popes judgement as infallible, might not be hereticall: and yet even for this very fact, thus much I muſt needs ſay, that if the Cardinall thinke it was the place, or the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that wrought this diſgracefull effect in <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it may bee truly replyed unto him much like as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Cic. lib. de Senect.</note> did to the fooliſh <hi>Seriphian,</hi> aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing his owne ignobility to the baſeneſſe of the towne of <hi>Seriphus,</hi> certainly though <hi>Silveſter, Iulius,</hi> and <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> had beene never ſo oft at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they had beene orthodoxall and heroicall Biſhops; but <hi>Vigilius</hi> hereticall and ignoble, though he had beene nayled to the poſts of the Vaticane, or chained to the pillars of it as faſt as <hi>Promethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> The ſoyle and ayre is as Catholike at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as in the very Laterane; it is as hereticall in Rome, as in any City in all the world. The onely difference is in the men themſelves, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, where ever they had come, caried with them conſtant, heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and truly pontificall minds; <hi>Vigilius</hi> in every place was of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, unſtable, diſſembling, hypocriticall, and hereticall ſpirit: which that every one may perceive, I will now in the laſt place, and in ſtead of an Epilogue to this whole Treatiſe, ſet downe a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the life of <hi>Vigilius:</hi> partly becauſe it may bee thought a great wrong to reject the narration of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> and not ſome way to ſupply that defect, touching the life of ſo memorable a Pope as was <hi>Vigilius;</hi> partly with a true report of this hereticall Popes life, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the labour of <hi>Baronius,</hi> in his malitious ſlanders of the religious
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:7680:246"/> Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian;</hi> and ſpecially becauſe <hi>Vigilius</hi> being the ſubject, (in a manner) of this whole Treatiſe, it ſeemes to mee needfull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the moſt materiall circumſtances, touching the entrance, the actions, the end of him, who hath occaſioned us to undertake this ſo long, and as I truly profeſſe, both laborious and irkſome labour.</p>

But let us returne to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> whom, I hope, you will now confeſſe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and graphically deſcribed by the penſill of their owne Apelles.</p>

See you not how vaine this ſhift of the Cardinall is?

Is it not enough that it is aſſuredly teſtified and recorded by S. <hi>Liberatus,</hi> by Biſhop <hi>Victor,</hi> two who lived and writ at that ſame time? what if moſt of them knew not of this Epiſtle, which was ſent ſecretly by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and by his advice kept cloſely by <hi>Anthimus</hi> and <hi>Severus?</hi> what if they all knew it, and yet having other crimes enough to object, thought it needleſſe to mention that, as it ſeemes they did the Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and cenſure of <hi>Silverius?</hi> what if they were not ſo ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as the Cardinall is, and therefore would not ſay the worſt they could againſt his Holineſſe?</p>
               <p n="28">28. But ſee the ſtrange dealing of the Cardinall! How or why ſhould <hi>Theodora</hi> upbrayd this to <hi>Vigilius</hi> for the not reſtoring of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimus?</hi> that quarrell for the reſtoring of <hi>Anthimus</hi> (as I have often ſayd, and clearly proved) was a meere deviſe and fiction of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> it was nothing but <hi>Alcibiades</hi> dogs tayle.

Are not theſe worthy reaſons to diſprove this Epiſtle to bee writ by <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> which all relie on fictions, &amp; on moſt untrue and idle fancies? And
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:7680:254"/> whether <hi>Facundus</hi> upbraided it or no, may bee queſtioned, nor will it bee clearly knowne, untill they will ſuffer <hi>Facundus</hi> to come out of their <hi>Vaticane,</hi> where hee lyeth yet impriſoned. But as for the fift Councell, it was great ſillineſſe in the Cardinall, once to thinke that they ſhould or would upbraid this Epiſtle to him, they uſed the Pope in the moſt honourable and reſpectfull manner that could be wiſhed, they uttered no one harſh or hard word againſt him, but what was rightly ſaid or done by him; as his condemning of <hi>Origen,</hi> his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> before the time of the Councell, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention and approve it alſo. They ſought by lenity to win the Popes heart to conſent unto the truth, which they defended: ſeeing they could not prevaile with him; yet they would have the whole world to teſtifie, together with the Popes peeviſhneſſe, their owne lenity, equity and moderation uſed towards him, and that it was not hatred or contempt of his perſon, nor any precedent occaſion, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the truth and equity of that preſent cauſe, which enforced them to involve him (remaining obdurate in his hereſie) in that <hi>Anathema</hi> which they in generall denounced againſt all the pertinacious defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> of which <hi>Vigilius</hi> was the chiefe, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearer to the reſt. Did the Cardinall thinke with ſuch poore ſleights to quit <hi>Vigilius</hi> of this Epiſtle? If nothing elſe, truely the very imbecillity and dulneſſe of the Cardinals reaſons and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this point may perſwade, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> and none but he was the author of it. <hi>Baronius</hi> was too unadviſed without better weapons to enter into the ſand, with old Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this cauſe, who is knowne to bee, <hi>plurimarum palmarum vetus ac nobilis gladiator,</hi> and in this combate with <hi>Baronius</hi> hee hath played the right <hi>Eutellus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

               <p n="29">29. <hi>Vigilius</hi> now, by juſt Duell, is proved to bee the true author of this Epiſtle: Be it ſo, ſay they<note n="k" place="margin">Etiamſi iſta verè ſcripſiſſet Vigilius, nullum tamen ob id in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur praejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium Apoſtolicae ſedi, cujus tunc ipſe erat invaſor, Silverius autem germanus Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex.

Truly by no other but the Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers argument, It is ſo, becauſe it is ſo, proofe they have none at all, they were ſo deſtitute of reaſons in this point, that laying this for their foundation to excuſe the Pope for teaching hereſie, they begge this, or rather take it without begging or asking, by vertue of that place called, <hi>Petitio Principij.</hi> Let us pardon <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Gretzer,</hi> who gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up onely the ſcraps under the Cardinals tables, but for a Cardinal ſo baſely and beggarly to behave himſelfe, as to diſpute from ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical

               <p n="31">31. This will further appeare by the other reaſon drawne from the time when this Epiſtle was written: <hi>Baronius</hi> referres it to the yeare 538. wherein <hi>Silverius</hi> was expelled, and faith<note n="n" place="margin">

This was the moſt Diabolicall plot and project of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> to ſeeme a Catholike, and openly to profeſſe before <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> and others the Catholike faith, and while they are ſecure of him, cloſely in the meane ſpace to undermine and blow up at once all Catholikes, and with them the Catholike faith.

Wee have now proved, firſt, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ this hereticall Epiſtle againſt their firſt evaſion, next that hee writ it when hee was the onely true and lawfull Pope, againſt their ſecond evaſion; there remains as yet two other Pretences of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but ſuch, as <hi>Baronius</hi> was aſhamed to uſe ſo poore and petty excuſes for their Pope. The third evaſion then is this, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in heart embraced the true faith, and onely fained himſelfe in this Epiſtle to be a favourer of the Eutychean hereſie. <hi>Vigilius,</hi> ſaith the Cardinall<note n="d" place="margin">Bell. lib. <hi>4.</hi> de Pontif. ca. <hi>10. §</hi> Sciendum.</note>, was here in a great ſtraite, for if hee openly profeſſed hereſie, hee feared the Romanes, who would never indure an heretike to ſit in <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire; if hee ſhould on the other ſide profeſſe himſelfe a Catholike, he feared <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odora</hi> the hereticall Empreſſe, that ſhe would not indure him; <hi>Itaque rationem illam excogitavit, therfore he deviſed this policy,</hi> (and I pray you note it well) that<note n="e" place="margin">Vt Romae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicum ageret, et interim per literas apud Jm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratricem, hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticum ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.

Thus <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the nature and diſpoſition of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as if hee had not onely felt his pulſe, but beene in his boſome: Hee was indeed another <hi>Catiline, Simulare, ac diſsimulare, hee could ſemble and diſſemble,</hi> conceale what indeed hee was, ſeeme to bee what hee was not: At <hi>Rome,</hi> and in ſhew of the world a Catholike; at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and in his ſecret and cloſe actions an heretike. Thus farre the Cardinall ſaith well; but hee is extremely miſtaken in one circumſtance, in that hee ſaith, that his open or Catholike profeſſion was mentall, and <hi>ex animo,</hi> and his private and ſecret deteſtation of the Catholike faith, was verball and fained. It was quite contrary, his heart and Intrals were all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, nothing but his face and outward ſhew was Catholike: for proofe whereof I will not urge, that the Pope in this Epiſtle accurſeth and<note n="f" place="margin">Qui dicit in Chriſto duas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas (<hi>i.</hi> naturas) et non confite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur unam perſoná unam eſſentiam anathema ſit.

The Powder-plotters dealt cloſely and ſecretly, all underboord: their pretended ſubjection was open, and yet the treaſon was ſerious, their obedience but fained. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was but a meere novice in the Romane Court when hee writ this, and imagined that Popes doe not ſeriouſly that which they doe ſecretly.</p>
               <p n="37">37. His other reaſon<note n="x" place="margin">Bell. ubi ſupra.</note> to prove that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was not in heart here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, when he writ this Epiſtle, is, becauſe he writ it not with an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall minde, <hi>ſed propter cupiditatem praeſidendi,</hi> but in an ambitious deſire of preſidency. What I pray you, Is an hereticall and ambitious minde incompatible? doth ambition exclude hereſie? or in ambition for one to teach hereſie, doth that hinder him from being in heart an heretike?

If they notwithſtanding their ambition were (as certainly they were) Arch-heretikes, and taught their hereſies with hereticall minds, then not onely the Cardinals reaſon is inconſequent and ridiculous, but <hi>Vigilius</hi> for all his ambition may not onely write that Epiſtle with an hereticall minde, but be even an Hereſiarch, or rather a Pope heretike.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Againe, did he not write this with an hereticall minde? why did not the Cardinall expreſſe what that hereticall minde is, which was now wanting in <hi>Vigilius?</hi> An hereticall minde is no other but a minde pertinaciouſly and obſtinately addicted to hereſie. It was he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie doubtleſſe which he writ, in teaching with <hi>Eutyches</hi> but one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be in Chriſt. That he writ this obſtinately, is cleare, ſeeing he writ it againſt the knowne judgement of the holy Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that is, of the Catholike Church; which none can doe but even thereby he ſhewes an obſtinate and pertinacious minde, rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church. If this be not, no hereticke in the world ever had an hereticall minde. If <hi>Arius, Neſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> when they writ or taught their doctrines with this minde, were hereticall and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, then moſt certainly <hi>Vigilius</hi> who writ this Epiſtle with the like obſtinate and pertinacious minde, muſt needs bee judged to be rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious againſt the Church, and as heretically affected in minde, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> or <hi>Eutyches</hi> himſelfe. Pride and inſolency is ſo farre from excluding an hereticall minde, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would here perſwade, that it is even an individuall companion, yea eſſentiall unto it. None can poſſibly have an hereticall, but <hi>eo nomine</hi> he hath an ambitious heart, the pride whereof cauſeth him to condemne the juſt ſentence of the Catholike Church, and prefer before it his owne fancy and opinion.</p>

You ſee now how inconſequent both theſe reaſons of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals are, ſeeing <hi>Vigilius</hi> might bee hereticall in heart, though both his writings were ſecret, and his minde ambitious. Let us yet a little further debate this matter with the Cardinall. Say you that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not write this hereticall Epiſtle <hi>ex animo,</hi> or from his heart? I pray you when looked your Cardinalſhip into the heart of <hi>Vigilius?</hi> how know you that he was not an heretike in heart, when he was ſo hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in profeſſion? or how know you of S. <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. or of any of all the Popes that lived ſince their times, that they were not heretikes and plaine Infidels in heart, when their words were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike? I would gladly for my learning be informed how <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or the moſt acute <hi>Lynceus</hi> of them all do or can know, otherwiſe than by their outward profeſſions, what any of all the Popes beleeved and thought in their heart. What <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, when he decreed the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:7680:259"/> doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation: what <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, when he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Luther:</hi> or what <hi>Paul, Iulius,</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their <hi>Trent</hi> Councell? How know you that in their hearts they beleeved thoſe doctrines? or that they did not diſſemble and faine, as you ſay <hi>Vigilius</hi> did? What can you ſay for <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, which may not be ſayd for <hi>Vigilius</hi> alſo? Doth <hi>Pius</hi> ſay, he did before, and now doth thinke as the <hi>Trent</hi> maſters doe? Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſayth the like, and moſt plainly, <hi>Eam fidem quam tenetis,</hi> that faith which you (<hi>Anthimus, Severus,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) doe hold, I ſignifie unto you, that I have held, and that I doe now hold the ſame. Doth <hi>Pius</hi> call the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers his beloved brethren in Chriſt? ſo doth <hi>Vigilius</hi> call thoſe hereticall Biſhops his beloved brethren in Chriſt: nay in <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> he calls them even Chriſts. Doth Pope <hi>Pius</hi> profeſſe an unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelfe and them, all making one body of the Church? Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth the like, and he doth it more ſignificantly: We, ſayth he, preach this ſame doctrine that you doe, <hi>Vt &amp; anima una ſit &amp; cor unum in Deo; ſo that there is in you and mee but one ſoule, and one heart in God.</hi> How can any ſpeech be cordiall, if this teſtifying himſelfe to be one ſoule and one heart with them, doe not come <hi>à fibris,</hi> but onely <hi>à labris?</hi> Doth Pope <hi>Pius</hi> approve the doctrine of the <hi>Trent</hi> conſpirators? So doth Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> the doctrine of thoſe <hi>Eutychean</hi> heretikes? Doth <hi>Pius</hi> condemne and anathematize <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and all who thinke or teach otherwiſe than himſelfe and his <hi>Trent</hi> Conventicle taught or beleeved? ſo doth Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> condemne and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all who deny two natures in Chriſt, all who beleeve otherwiſe than himſelfe and his <hi>Eutychean</hi> fellow heretikes did. In all theſe there is as much to be ſayd for Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as for Pope <hi>Pius:</hi> and if you pleaſe to adde that one other agreement alſo, as of <hi>Vigilius</hi> it is ſayd, that they knew <hi>crudelitatem fidei;</hi> ſo may it in like manner bee truly ſayd of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> that this did manifeſt unto all men, <hi>crudelitatem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei, the cruelty of his and his Trent Councels faith.</hi> If by theſe outward acts the Cardinall can know <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth to have <hi>ex animo</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their <hi>Trent</hi> hereſies, why can he not by the like outward acts know <hi>Vigilius</hi> to have <hi>ex animo</hi> condemned the Catholike faith? If <hi>Vigilius</hi> for all theſe outward acts, and ſo many teſtimonies and evidences of a willing minde did diſſemble, and thinke in his heart otherwiſe than he writ, how will or can the Cardinall prove unto us that <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. and the whole Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> did not diſſemble, and both write and ſpeake otherwiſe than they thought in heart? Hath the Cardinall ſome windowes to pry into the ſecrets of the heart of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth and the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, which are dammed up that he cannot ſee into the breſt of <hi>Vigilius?</hi> If Pope <hi>Pius</hi> upon his word and writing be to be credited, much more is Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> ſeeing he did not only by words and writing teach this hereticall doctrine, but (which <hi>Pius</hi> did not) he bound himſelfe by a ſacred oath that hee would teach the ſame. And which is yet a farre greater evidence, <hi>Vigilius</hi> after this did teach the like hereticall doctrine, to overthrow the ſame Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the cauſe of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> which hee did ſo unfainedly and ſo cordially, that for teaching the ſame he incurred the juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:7680:259"/> of the Emperour, the curſe of the holy generall Councell, the publike hatred of all Catholikes, and, if wee may beleeve <hi>Baronius,</hi> even exile and perſecution alſo. Why might not the ſame <hi>Vigilius</hi> from his heart teach <hi>Eutycheaniſme,</hi> as well as <hi>Neſtorianiſme?</hi> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe two hereſies looke contrary wayes indeed, but their tayles, like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes, are joyned together to undermine the Catholike faith, and the holy Councell of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> Hee who once is proved to be treacherous in this ſort, and to doe this once from his heart, <hi>ſemper praeſumitur,</hi> is alwayes to bee preſumed treacherous in the ſame kinde: Hee who did this in the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> would have done it in <hi>Eutycheaniſme,</hi> his heart, his deſire, his purpoſe at both times was the ſame; the odds was accidental in the oportunity which ſerved bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the one, than in the other; what need they excuſe his teaching <hi>Eutycheaniſme</hi> to have been only labiall, when it is cleare his teaching of <hi>Neſtorianiſme</hi> was cordiall? If they cannot excuſe Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> for teaching <hi>Neſtorianiſme</hi> from his heart, which cannot poſſibly be done, what need they be ſo nice in denying his teaching of <hi>Eutycheaniſme</hi> to have come from the ſame heart? his fault in them both being alike, one anſwer will alike ſerve for them both.</p>
               <p n="44">44. But what, thinke you, meant the Cardinall ſo to buſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and bee ſo curious about the heart and ſecret minde of <hi>Vigilius?</hi> what though hee did not in heart, yet, <hi>exteriori profeſsione,</hi> by his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall writing, by his outward confeſſion, by that <hi>Vigilius</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Catholike faith, as the Cardinall<note n="d" place="margin">Dico Vigilium ſcripſiſſe illam Epiſtolam, et damnaſſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam fidem, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem exteriori profeſſione.

                     <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.39.</note> knoweth and ſeeth the hearts of all the ſonnes of men; let men, who cannot ſee the heart, looke to his words, to his writings, to that profeſſion, by which hee teacheth others. If that be hereticall, what boots it them though his heart bee orthodoxall? <hi>Confirma fratres, &amp; paſce oves,</hi> are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts, they looke abroad and outwardly, not to the inward and hidden man in the Popes breaſt. If he think as <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and teach as <hi>Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magus,</hi> as <hi>Arius, Neſtorius,</hi> or <hi>Eutyches</hi> did, is he not an hereticall teacher, an hereticall Pope, a confirmer of his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hereſie, a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nay, a very priſoner of the ſheepe, with worſe weeds than the Socraticall Cicuta? If the Pope onely thinke and beleeve hereſie, why, thought is free, (to wit, from mans eye, much more from his cenſure) his thought is for himſelfe, that errour is perſonall, it hurts none but the Pope himſelfe. If either by word or writing hee teach hereſie, that is Pontificall, it is the fault of his office, of his Chayre, which ſhould have beene infallible, this hurts his ſheepe and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Nor skilleth it at all in what manner, whether by word or writing, by what occaſion or motive hee teacheth hereſie, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all, or upon any occaſion hee wittingly and willingly teach it, that is the onely point which is queſtioned. <hi>Vigilius</hi> condemned the Catholike faith, ſaith Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Bell. loco cit.</note>, but hee did it for ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſire of preſidency. Bee it ſo: If the Pope for ambition
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:7680:260"/> may condemne the Catholike faith; why may hee not doe ſo, for feare of exile, of diſgrace, of loſing the Emperours, or the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or the French Kings favour? If for feare, why not for favour to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the good will of thoſe, or any of them? If for favour, why not for hatred, hatred of <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, the Emperour; of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, for pulling away the beſt feather out of the Popes Plume; of <hi>Luther</hi> for being ſo buſie in medling with his Indulgences, and the triple Crowne? If for hatred or favour, why not for deſire of lucre, and to keepe the gaine of their crafts-men and Image workers, who continually ſing that note in the Popes eare, Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, great is the Church and S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chayre? Why not for any like paſſion of the minde may the Pope condemne the Catholike faith? On what a tickliſh and ſlippery ground doth their whole faith ſtand, when either the Popes ambition, or feare, or favour, or love, or hatred, or anger, or deſire, or a fit of any other perturbation, which diſturbeth his minde, may procure, as at this time it did in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> an anathema to the Catholike faith? Beſt it were for them to renew the Stoicall ſect and doctrine, and receive it in the Church; that out of thoſe ſober and unmoved mindes, as out of an happy Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Popes, the Cardinals might in the Conclave ſtill elect a Pope voyde of all paſſions and perturbations, and tranſplant him out of the Stoicall to their <hi>Apoſtolicall Chaire.</hi> But ſure, ſo long as they goe no further than the Conclave, they ſhall never finde any but of the ſame metall with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> one that may bee toſſed every way with ambition, with envy, with love, with hatred, with feare, and every paſſion of his minde, as a powder-plot to blow up the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith; and when he hath done that by his words, by his writing, by his preaching and teaching, by any of his outward acts whatſoever, Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can excuſe it, and wipe away all the diſgrace of it, as here hee doth in <hi>Vigilius;</hi> hee did it not with an hereticall minde, for hee did it for ambition, hee did it for feare, hee did it for hatred; hee did it for ſome other paſſion, hee did it onely by an exteriour act, and not <hi>ex animo:</hi> But in the meane time whether hee did it <hi>ex ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> or otherwiſe by his exteriour act, the Catholike faith is blowne up from the foundation thereof, as much by the Popes act, as by the act of <hi>Arius,</hi> of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> or any other heretike; and the Church hath a goodly amends indeed, that the Pope forſooth did not (which is impoſſible for him or all heretikes in the world to doe) blow it up with an imagination or inward thought, but with an exteriour act of his teaching by word or writing.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Oh but, ſayth <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Bell. loc. cit.</note>, <hi>non damnavit fidem palam, ſed occultè, Vigilius did not openly but cloſely condemne the Catholike faith:</hi> Cloſely, ſo he did indeed; it was his purpoſe and intent ſo to doe. He came not now as <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> with open force to batter, but as <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Arius, Neſtorius, Eutyches,</hi> and other heretikes, with <hi>Synomian</hi> arts, to undermine the Church; all his worke was under the vault. The Anathema denounced in this Epiſtle againſt all who hold two natures in Chriſt, was the powder that ſhould have blowne up the holy Synod, and Senate, the Houſe of God, and whole City of God:
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:7680:260"/> the powder, the perſon and all was ready, onely, which the Cardinall obſerves<note n="g" place="margin">Vt ſint omnia occulta, uſque ad tempus. Bell. loc. cit.</note>, the time for the open publiſhing of that Anathema, and ſetting fire to the traine was not yet come. The gracious Providence of God, which watcheth over Iſraell, the admirable zeale, piety, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and <hi>vigilancy,</hi> which God put into the heart of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> the conſtancy of faith in the Greeke Church, which at that time moſt happily fell out to bee greater than at any time before or ſince; by theſe was the fatall blow intended by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> moſt happily preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This cloſe and ſecret working proves Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> to have beene both ſubtill and malicious in condemning the faith; it doth excuſe him neither <hi>à toto,</hi> nor <hi>tanto,</hi> from his condemning the faith or from being an hereticall Pope, labouring by his hereticall doctrine to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the faith.</p>
               <p n="42">42. The fourth and laſt Evaſion or excuſe for <hi>Vigilius</hi> fact in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Epiſtle, is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> alſo; <hi>Vigilius,</hi> ſaith hee<note n="h" place="margin">Bell. <hi>4.</hi> de Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. ca. <hi>10. §</hi> Sciendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note>, did not at that time define any thing againſt the faith, <hi>tanquam Pontifex,</hi> as hee was Pope. What ſhuffling and ſhifting is this in the Cardinall? hee did not define any thing againſt the faith, as Pope: Hee did then define that which was againſt the faith, but hee defined it not as Pope, for otherwiſe it had beene fooliſh to ſay, he defined it not as Pope, when hee defined it, neither as Pope, nor as no Pope, when hee defined it not at all. Againe, what a worthy ſaying is this of a Cardinall? <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> did not at that time define it as hee was Pope; at that time, to wit, while <hi>Silverius</hi> lived and was the onely Pope, at which time, as himſelfe in expreſſe words ſaith, <hi>Vigilius Papa non erat, Vigilius was not then the Pope.</hi> What needed the Cardinall ſay hee defined it not at that time as hee was Pope, when at that time he was not Pope? This reduplication, <hi>quatenus Papa,</hi> implies hee was Pope, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope hee defined it, but hee defined it not as hee was Pope, but as hee was a private man, or ſome other way: Would not the Cardinall laugh, if <hi>Gretzer</hi> or any ſuch good friend of his ſhould ſay, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> at that time while hee was at <hi>Ingolſtad</hi> writ not his Controverſies as he was Pope, or, hee writ them not as he was a Turke, a Iew, or Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane? But leaving theſe ſhifts, which demonſtrate plainly, that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> had a deſire to ſay ſomewhat in excuſe of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but knew not what, and therefore ſnatched at this or that, or any thing, though it were never ſo croſſe unto himſelfe, and ſuch alſo as he could not hold. Let us conſider the Exception it ſelfe; <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ this Epiſtle, that is confeſſed; hee writ it when hee was the onely true and lawfull Pope, that wee have proved; hee defined hereſie in it, and that which is againſt the faith, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> implyeth; hee condemned in it the Catholike faith, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in plaine words expreſſeth. Thus far the cauſe is cleare. Now whether Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> in it defined here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and condemned the Catholike faith, as he was Pope, or no, that is the point here to be debated.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Some may thinke, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by thoſe two reaſons drawne from ſecreſie and an ambitious minde, by which he laboured before, to prove, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not condemne the faith <hi>ex animo,</hi> meant alſo that he condemned it not as Pope, for it followeth in the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:7680:261"/> next ſentence, <hi>ſiquidem Epiſtolam ſcripſit,</hi> as giving a reaſon of his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If any like to take <hi>Bellar.</hi> words in that ſort, then his reaſons are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand refuted; for as <hi>Vigilius</hi> might, <hi>ex animo,</hi> write heretically, both privately and out of ambition, ſo alſo might hee, <hi>tanquam Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex,</hi> condemne the faith, notwithſtanding both his ſecrecy and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mind; ſecrecy and an ambitious mind are no more repugnant to the one, than to the other, they are compatible with them both; the Pope may uſe his <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authority in teaching, as wel private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as publikely, as well with <hi>Iudas</hi> in ambition, as with <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> in ſincerity of heart. But the Cardinals Apologiſt, who it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Cardinall about his intent herein, doth eaſe us of thoſe reaſons, for hee<note n="i" place="margin">Gretz. loc. cit.</note> tels us plainly, that from <hi>Vigilius</hi> his deſire of ſecrecie, <hi>nil aliud colligit, Bellarmine collects or proves nothing elſe,</hi> but this, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not write his letter from his heart or <hi>ſeriò,</hi> that hee did it not in earneſt. It is but a ſport with <hi>Gretzer,</hi> or with the Pope, to condemne the Catholike faith; they doe it, but they doe it not in earneſt, they doe it <hi>jocularitèr</hi> not <hi>ſeriò.</hi> Have ye indeed ſuch May-games &amp; ſports at <hi>Rome,</hi> as to condemne the faith, and then ſay, I was in jeſt, and in ſport? Are not theſe men new Philiſtines, Call in <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Condemne the Catholike faith, to make us paſtime? But let us leave them to their ſports, till the fall of their Babyloniſh houſe make a cataſtrophe and dolefull end both of their actors &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators: That which I now note, is, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not in thoſe words, <hi>Siquidem Epiſtolam ſcripſit, &amp;c.</hi> from the privateneſſe or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy prove any thing elſe, but that <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ it not <hi>ſeriò,</hi> in earneſt and from his heart; that hee writ it not, <hi>tanquam Pontifex,</hi> this thoſe words prove not, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in thoſe words collects not: So we have now nothing but the bare ſaying of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> without any proofe, without any reaſons, and I muſt needs confeſſe, I hold it a moſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient encounter for any man to <hi>Bellarmines ipſe dixit,</hi> to oppoſe, <hi>ipſe dico,</hi> yet becauſe I deſire rather to ſatisfie ſuch as ſeeke the truth, then contend with thoſe who ſeeke to ſmother and betray the truth, I will a little further enlarge this point, and ſee if it may be cleared by evidence of reaſon, that Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not onely condemne the Catholike faith at that time, but that he did it even as hee was Pope, and, <hi>tanquam Pontifex,</hi> condemne the Catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="44">44. What it is for a Pope to teach an errour as Pope, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by other Arts and Sciences, in the practice or exerciſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together with knowledge, judgement, and skill, fidelity alſo is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; were <hi>Baronius</hi> or ſome Romane <hi>Facundus</hi> to examine this point, they would quickly ſute the Pope to ſome Cobler, Pedler, or ſuch like companion: I love not to deale ſo rudely with his Holineſſe, yet if I ſhould happen at any time to let ſlip a word that way, you know how the Cardinall quitted the religious Emperour with, <hi>Ne ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra crepidam.</hi> If a Phyſitian, or Lawyer, or Iudge in any diſcourſe ſhould ſpeake barbarouſly or incongruouſly, they erre therein but as Grammarians, not as Iudges, Lawyers or Phyſitians; But if a Iudge for any ſiniſter reſpect ſhould pronounce that ſentence as juſt, which is againſt the law; or if a Lawyer ſhould after his diligent ſifting of
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:7680:261"/> the cauſe, affirme that title to bee ſound, which were clearely voide in law; or if a Phyſitian ſhould preſcribe to his patient Coloquintida for an wholeſome diet, each of them now erred &amp; offended in his owne profeſſion, &amp; in that proper duty w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> belongeth to them; the Iudge as a Iudge, the Counſellor as a Counſellor, the Phyſitian as a Phyſitian, becauſe they failed either in skill or in fidelity in thoſe faculties wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they profeſſe both to know themſelves, and to make knowne unto others what is right and good: If in other matters they tranſgreſſe, it is not, <hi>quatenus tales;</hi> if any of them bee prophane, covetous, or intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, they offend now, <hi>quatenus homines,</hi> as they are mortall men in thoſe duties of morality, which are common to them with all men: If they bee ſeditious, rebellious, and conſpire in treaſonable practice, they offend, <hi>quatenus Cives,</hi> as they are parts of the Common-wealth, in thoſe duties which are common to them with all ſubjects; but when they offend in Phyſick, law, or judgment, thoſe are their own peculiar Arts and Sciences, they then offend, neither <hi>quatenus homines,</hi> nor <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus Cives,</hi> nor in any other reſpect, but <hi>quatenus tales,</hi> as they are ſuch profeſſors: for now they tranſgreſſe againſt thoſe proper duties, which, as they are Iudges, Counſellors, or Phyſitians, are required of them. The like of all Artificers, of Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marians, Logicians, Poets, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, of Preſbyters, of Biſhops, of the Profeſſors of Theology, which is <hi>ſcientia ſcientiarum,</hi> is to bee ſaid. If a Divine ſhall ſpeake rudely, incongruouſly, <hi>ad populum Antiochenum,</hi> he offends as a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian, not as a Divine, unleſſe perhaps it bee no fault when it doth ſo happen for edification, that hee ought ſo to ſpeake, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten</hi>

If yet wee ſhall goe ſomewhat more preciſely and exactly to worke, according to line and meaſure; thoſe acts of feeding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming doe but in a very equivocall ſenſe (for their doctrine is full of Equivocation) agree to other Biſhops, but ſtill a maine difference or odds is to bee obſerved, betwixt the Popes feeding and confirming, as hee is Pope, and all others; when any other Biſhop teacheth hereſie, becauſe his teaching is ſubordinate and fallible, one may, nay, he muſt doubt or feare to feed on ſuch food, he muſt ſtill receive it with this caution or <hi>tacit</hi> appeale of his heart, if his holineſſe commend it for an wholeſome diet of the ſoule.

But this quirke and ſubtilty will not helpe their cauſe, nor excuſe the Pope from erring as Pope; for as in this ſenſe no Pope, as Pope, doth erre, becauſe then every Pope ſhould erre in all doctrines which hee teacheth, ſo neither in the ſame ſenſe doth any Pope, as Pope, teach the truth, for then every doctrine of every Pope ſhould bee true. Againe, as according to this ſenſe, no Pope as Pope, ſo no Biſhop as Biſhop, no Preſbyteras Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter doth erre or teach hereſie, for did hee in his teaching erre as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Preſbyter, then every Preſbyter and every Biſhop, and ſo even the Apoſtles themſelves ſhould erre in their teaching. But as <hi>Vigilius</hi> or <hi>Liberius</hi> when they taught <hi>Arianiſme, Eutycheaniſme,</hi> or <hi>Neſtorianiſme,</hi> did this not ſimply as Popes, but as perſons not knowing as in duty they ſhould, what to teach; or knowing it, but willingly teaching the contrary to their knowledge, which in duty they ſhould not: even ſo <hi>Neſtorius, Macedonius, Arius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Biſhop, and Preſbyter, when they erred, they erred not ſimply as Biſhops, or as Preſbyters, but as perſons failing in their Epiſcopall, or Preſbyteriall duties, either not knowing the truth, as by their office they ſhould, or wilfully oppugning and contradicting the truth, as by their office they ſhould not: So by his ſubtilty, if any applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it, not only the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> yea, all Biſhops and Preſbyters in the world ſhall be as free from errour, as his holineſſe himſelfe, yea, all profeſſors of any Art, Science, or faculty, ſhall plead the like Papall exemption from errour; every man ſhall bee a Pope in his owne faculty; no Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſpeaking incongruouſly as a Grammarian, but as wanting the skil required in a Grammarian; no Iudge giving a wrongfull ſentence as a Iudge, no Galeniſt miniſtring unwholſome phyſicke as a Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, no Artificer working any thing amiſſe in his trade, as an Artificer, but as being defective in the duties either of that knowledge, or of that fidelity which is required in a Iudge, a Phyſitian, and in every Artificer. If they will exempt all Biſhops and Preſbyters, all Iudges and Phyſitians from erring, as they are ſuch Officers or Artificers, we alſo will in the ſame ſort and ſenſe allow the like immunity to the Pope: If they notwithſtanding this ſubtilty, will admit another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:7680:263"/> to erre as Biſhop, they muſt not thinke much if wee exempt not the Pope as Pope: For, to ſpeake that which is the very truth of them all, and exactly to meaſure every thing by his owne line, a Iudge ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as Iudge doth pronounce a judiciall ſentence, as a skilfull and faithfull judge, an upright judiciall ſentence; as an unskilful or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudge, an erronious or unjuſt ſentence. A Biſhop or Preſbyter ſimply as Biſhop or Preſbyter, doth teach with publike authority in the Church; as a skilfull and faithfull Biſhop or Preſbyter he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth of God; as an ignorant and unfaithful Biſhop he teacheth errours and hereſies in the Church, the one without, the other with judicall power to cenſure the gainſayers. The like in all Arts, Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and faculties is to be ſayd, even in the Pope himſelfe. A Pope ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as he is Pope and defined by them, teacheth both with authority to teach, with power to cenſure the gainſayers, and with a ſupremacy of judgement binding all to embrace his doctrine without appeale, without doubt, as an <hi>infallible</hi> Oracle: as a skilfull or faithfull Pope he teacheth the truth in that ſort, as an unskilfull or unfaithfull Pope he teacheth errour or hereſie with the like authority, power, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, binding others to receive and ſwallow up his hereſies for Catholike truth, and that with a moſt blind obedience, without once doubting of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Apply this to <hi>Vigilius</hi> &amp; his hereticall Epiſtle: In a vulgar ſenſe; <hi>Vig.</hi> erred as Pope, becauſe he erred in thoſe very Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifical duties of feeding &amp; confirming, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are proper to his office. In a ſtrickt ſenſe; though hee did not therein erre ſimply as Pope, but <hi>quatenus talis</hi> taught onely with a ſupreme binding authority, yet hee erred as an unfaithfull Pope, binding others by that his Pontificall and ſupreme authority to receive <hi>Eutycheaniſme</hi> as Catholike truth, without once moving any doubt or making ſcruple of the ſame.

The like in many other Epiſtles of <hi>Leo,</hi> and of other Popes might eaſily bee obſerved. Not the tenth part of their decretal Epiſtles, ſuch as they writ as Popes, have this clauſe of doing it by their <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> authority expreſſed in them. It is ſufficient that this is vertually in them all, and vertually it is in this of Pope <hi>Vigilius:</hi> Yea, but hee taught this onely in a private letter to a few, to <hi>Anthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Severus</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> not in a publike, generall, and encyclicall Epiſtle, written for inſtruction of the whole Church.

Both w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> becauſe they are hid from mans eyes, the Church leaving the judgement of certainty and verity onely to God, paſſeth her ſentence which is the judgement of charity, by the outward and apparent acts which are open unto them: whomſoever ſhee ſeeth not, nor findes by certaine and evident proofe to have manifeſted the deteſtation and revocation of their hereticall and impious writings, which before they publiſhed and maintained, all thoſe though dead ten, an hundred, or a thouſand years before, ſhe by her cenſure doth, and doth moſt juſtly condemne, accurſe, and anathematize, as by her ſentence againſt <hi>Theodorus</hi> of Mopſveſtia, dead an hundred yeares before, is moſt evident, whoſe condemnation and anathema pronounced by the fift Councell, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by all ſucceeding generall Councels, by all Catholikes, and even by the whole Catholike Church. Nor will I here diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a ſentence doth not ſometimes paſſe, <hi>errante clave,</hi> the party having repented, whom they not having proofe of his repentance, thought to dye impenitent; but howſoever that fall out, none may juſtly complaine of the Churches judgement as unjuſt or unequall herein; for beſides that it is preſumed, that thoſe who ſo notoriouſly and publikely by their hereticall writings doe ſcandalize the Church and people of God, if they had ſeriouſly repented would have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome publike and outward teſtimony of the ſame; the Church would by this ſeverity of her cenſure, teach all men a leſſon which is very hard to learne; firſt, that they ſhould not have ſuch an itch and ambitious deſire to write or utter thoſe deteſtable hereſies which lurk within their breaſts; or if they cannot obſerve that, yet at leaſt to learne to be ſo lowly and humble in heart, as to revoke their impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and blaſphemies, although to ſome blemiſh and diſgrace of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet to the great honour of Gods truth, and the ſatisfaction and edification of the holy Church, which they had ſcandalized. If in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition they will firſt oppugne the truth, and then in a worſe pride of heart, not be reclamed to the truth, nor ſhew their love unto it, why ſhould not the Church by her moſt charitable judgement ſhew her open deteſtation of their perſons, who in the inſolency of their hearts will not ſhew any open deteſtation of their hereſies? That <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ a papall Conſtitution in defence of hereſie, it is apparent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable: that he at any time revoked that writing, I wiſh it were, but it is not yet evident. The like may be ſayd of <hi>Baronius,</hi> of <hi>Pighius,</hi> of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:7680:265"/> 
                  <hi>Eccius,</hi> of the <hi>Laterane, Florentine,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> conſpirators, of all who have whet their tongues againſt other truth, and ſpecially to uphold that fundamentall hereſie of the Popes <hi>infallibility.</hi> Their writings for hereſie are evident, that they ever reclamed thoſe writings, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident: and if ever they and their cauſe come to bee tryed, in ſuch a free, lawfull, and oecumenicall Councell as was this fift under <hi>Iuſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> they may juſtly feare, and certainly expect from the Church, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the diſclaming of their writings may by certaine proofe be made knowne) the very like ſentence, though a hundred yeares after theirs, as paſſed upon <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſveſtia</hi> an hundred yeares after his death. And becauſe the houre-glaſſe for repentance is runne out to the former, all that we can doe, is (which I ſeriouſly now doe from my heart) to cry amaine unto others, to admoniſh, exhort, yea even pray and entreat them by the mercies of God, and by the love of their owne ſoules, firſt that they keepe their tongues and pennes from once uttering any hereſie; or (if they have not done that) with the ſame hands to give the medicine, wherewith they gave the wound, and as openly, nay much more openly to diſclame than they have ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed their impious and hereticall doctrines.</p>
               <p n="53">53. You have now ſome view both of the life and death of <hi>Vigilius.</hi> The exact pourtraiture of the Popes lives, <hi>Baronius</hi> had beene able to ſet forth if he had liſted; but he addeth ſuch <hi>fucos,</hi> and ſo many ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall colours, that indeed ſcarce you ſhall ſee any one of them in his Annals ſet out in his native and naturall habit. If ought be amiſſe in this our deſcription, and not ſet forth according to the lively linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his impieties, the equall reader will not too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly cenſure the ſame. I acknowledge that I can but <hi>dolare</hi> in this kinde; to poliſh and ſet forth the lively image of their Popes, I have not learned: That is an Art which may not bee too vulgar, leſt their Romane policies be too farre divulged. But by this it is eaſie to perceive what a ſilly excuſe it is which <hi>Baronius</hi> uſeth in this cauſe, blaming <hi>Vigilius</hi> for coming to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as if not the Popes owne hereticall minde, but the ayre of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had wrought ſuch effects, as to produce that hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and yet as they count it, <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitution</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi>
